   - **Key Features**: Swarm coordination, loop execution, template management
   - **Target Users**: AI engineers, developers, automation specialists
   - **Timeline**: 25 weeks to v1.0
   - **Success Metrics**: Adoption, performance, user satisfaction
   - **Strategic Value**: Democratize advanced AI agent workflows

4. **Format Content Consistently**

   **Markdown Formatting:**
   - Use consistent heading levels (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
   - Format code blocks with language identifiers
   - Use tables for structured data
   - Include diagrams in Mermaid or ASCII art
   - Add anchors for cross-references
   - Use consistent bullet/numbering styles

   **Content Enhancement:**
   - Add visual separators between major sections
   - Include "TL;DR" boxes for complex sections
   - Add "Key Takeaways" at end of major sections
   - Create summary tables for requirements and metrics
   - Add page breaks for print formatting
   - Include version and date in header

5. **Create Diagrams**

   **System Architecture Diagram (Mermaid):**
   ```mermaid
   graph TB
       CLI[CLI Interface]
       CLI --> TM[TemplateManager]
       CLI --> SO[SwarmOrchestrator]
       CLI --> LE[LoopExecutor]
       CLI --> TC[TaskCoordinator]

       SO --> CC[ClaudeClient]
       LE --> CC
       TC --> TQ[TaskQueue]

       TQ --> QR[(QueueRepository)]
       SO --> SS[(StateStore)]
       TM --> GH[GitHub API]
       CC --> CLAUDE[Claude API]
   ```

   **Task Execution Flow (Mermaid):**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       User->>CLI: abathur task submit
       CLI->>TaskCoordinator: enqueue(task)
       TaskCoordinator->>Queue: add task
       SwarmOrchestrator->>Queue: dequeue
       SwarmOrchestrator->>Agent: execute
       Agent->>Claude API: request
       Claude API->>Agent: response
       Agent->>StateStore: save result
       Agent->>User: return result
   ```

   **Implementation Timeline (ASCII Gantt):**
   ```
   Phase 0: Foundation         [==]
   Phase 1: Infrastructure           [====]
   Phase 2: Template                 [==]
   Phase 3: Claude Integration            [====]

            Wk1    Wk5    Wk10   Wk15   Wk20   Wk25
   ```

6. **Cross-Reference and Validate**

   **Consistency Checks:**
   - Requirement IDs referenced in architecture

   - API specs match system design
   - Timeline aligns with dependencies
   - No contradictions between sections

   **Completeness Checks:**
   - All functional requirements covered
   - All NFRs addressed in architecture
   - All use cases supported by features
   - All risks have mitigation strategies
   - All components have specifications

7. **Add Supporting Materials**

   - Agent: An instance of Claude performing tasks
   - Swarm: Multiple agents coordinated to execute tasks
   - Loop: Iterative task execution with convergence
   - Orchestrator: Component managing agent coordination

   - Related projects (LangChain, CrewAI, etc.)

   **Decision Log:**
   - Copy resolved decisions from DECISION_POINTS.md
   - Include rationale for each decision
   - Link decisions to affected sections

8. **Generate Final PRD Document**

   Create a single, comprehensive markdown file:
   - Filename: `ABATHUR_PRD.md`
   - Include version number and date
   - Add table of contents with links
   - Format for readability (both screen and print)
   - Include all diagrams and tables
   - Add metadata header

9. **Create Supplementary Documents**

   - One-page overview of Abathur
   - Key features and benefits
   - Quick start instructions
   - Common commands reference

   **Technical Architecture Diagram:**
   - Standalone high-quality diagram
   - Multiple formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)
   - Suitable for presentations

**Best Practices:**
- Write for multiple audiences (technical, business, users)
- Use active voice and clear language
- Define acronyms on first use
- Include examples and illustrations
- Make document navigable (TOC, links)
- Use consistent terminology
- Avoid jargon where possible
- Provide context for technical decisions
- Make requirements traceable
- Include visual aids
