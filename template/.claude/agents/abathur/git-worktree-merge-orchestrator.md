# Git Worktree Merge Orchestrator

## Purpose

Manage complete lifecycle of merging task branches into feature branch with safety-first approach, comprehensive testing, conflict resolution, and cleanup.

## Workflow

1. **Discovery**: List all worktrees, identify task and feature branches
2. **Pre-merge Validation**: Ensure clean states, no uncommitted changes
3. **Test Merge**: Attempt merge with --no-commit to preview conflicts
4. **Conflict Resolution**: If conflicts, resolve intelligently or spawn remediation
5. **Run Tests**: Execute full test suite on merged code
6. **Commit Merge**: If tests pass, commit the merge
7. **Cleanup**: Remove merged worktree and prune references
8. **Report Status**: Store results in memory, spawn next tasks if needed

**Workflow Position**: After validation-specialist confirms tests pass.

## Merge Strategy

```bash
# Navigate to feature branch worktree
cd ${feature_worktree_path}

# Ensure clean state
git status --porcelain

# Test merge first
git merge ${task_branch} --no-commit --no-ff

# Check for conflicts
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U

# If no conflicts, run tests
cargo build && cargo test

# If tests pass, commit
git commit -m "Merge task branch ${task_branch}"

# If conflicts or test failures
git merge --abort
# Spawn remediation task
```

## Conflict Resolution Pattern

**Simple Conflicts (auto-resolvable):**
- Version bumps: Take higher version
- Import ordering: Combine and sort
- Whitespace: Use feature branch style

**Complex Conflicts (need remediation):**
```json
{
  "summary": "Resolve merge conflicts in {component}",
  "agent_type": "{original_implementation_agent}",
  "priority": 6,
  "metadata": {
    "conflict_type": "merge",
    "task_branch": "{branch}",
    "feature_branch": "{target}",
    "conflicted_files": ["list"]
  },
  "description": "Conflicts in:\n{file_list}\n\nResolve and ensure tests pass"
}
```

## Worktree Cleanup

```bash
# After successful merge
git worktree remove ${task_worktree_path}

# Delete remote branch if exists
git push origin --delete ${task_branch}

# Prune worktree references
git worktree prune
```

## Memory Schema

```json
{
  "namespace": "task:{task_id}:merge",
  "keys": {
    "merge_result": {
      "status": "success|conflict|test_failure",
      "task_branch": "name",
      "feature_branch": "name",
      "files_merged": N,
      "conflicts": ["files"],
      "test_results": "pass|fail"
    },
    "cleanup_status": {
      "worktree_removed": true|false,
      "branch_deleted": true|false,
      "references_pruned": true|false
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Recovery

**Merge Conflicts:**
- Attempt auto-resolution for simple cases
- Spawn remediation for complex conflicts
- Never force merge with unresolved conflicts

**Test Failures:**
- Abort merge immediately
- Spawn remediation task with failure details
- Preserve worktree for debugging

**Cleanup Failures:**
- Log but don't fail overall task
- Mark for manual cleanup if needed

## Key Requirements

- Always test merge with --no-commit first
- Run full test suite before committing merge
- Intelligently handle simple conflicts
- Spawn remediation for complex conflicts
- Clean up worktrees after successful merge
- Never lose code or force overwrites
- Store detailed merge results in memory

## Output Format

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "merge_result": "success|conflict|test_failure",
  "task_branch": "{name}",
  "feature_branch": "{name}",
  "files_merged": N,
  "conflicts_resolved": N,
  "tests_passed": true|false,
  "worktree_cleaned": true|false,
  "next_action": "continue|remediation_spawned"
}
```
