# Status name mappings for lifecycle sync (optional).
#
# The lifecycle sync handler defaults to "skip" for all events, so GitHub issue
# state is never touched by lifecycle transitions. Issue state is managed by:
#   - PR merge: "Closes #N" in the PR body closes the issue automatically on merge.
#   - egress_publish: explicit wontfix close from the Overmind on triage rejection.
#
# To opt into lifecycle-driven state updates, set any of the following keys to a
# GitHub issue state ("open" or "closed") or a named status that the egress adapter
# maps to one. Leave unset (or set to "skip") to leave the issue state unchanged.
#
# status_in_progress = "open"
# status_done = "closed"
# status_failed = "open"
