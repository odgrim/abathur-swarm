- Spawn and coordinate 10+ Claude agents concurrently
- Iterative refinement with intelligent convergence detection
- Production-ready orchestration without complex infrastructure setup

### Key Capabilities

1. **Template-Driven Workflows**
   - Git-native template management
   - Shared configuration with Claude Code
   - One-command project initialization

2. **Swarm Coordination**
   - Hierarchical agent spawning
