## 6. Out of Scope

### 6.1 Explicitly Excluded Features (V1)

#### OOS-001: Distributed/Clustered Deployment
- **Description**: Running Abathur across multiple machines with shared queue
- **Rationale**: Adds significant complexity; single-node sufficient for target use cases
- **Future Consideration**: V2+ may support Redis-based distributed queue

#### OOS-002: Web UI / Dashboard
- **Description**: Browser-based interface for task management
- **Rationale**: CLI-first design philosophy; web UI increases maintenance burden
- **Future Consideration**: Community-contributed web UI as separate project

#### OOS-003: Built-In CI/CD Integration
- **Description**: Native plugins for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
- **Rationale**: Can be achieved through CLI scripting; premature to build integrations
- **Future Consideration**: Official CI/CD examples and documentation

#### OOS-004: Multi-LLM Support
- **Description**: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, local models in same system
- **Rationale**: Claude-native design; multi-LLM adds abstraction complexity
- **Future Consideration**: Plugin architecture for other LLMs if demand exists

#### OOS-005: Real-Time Collaboration
- **Description**: Multiple users working on same Abathur instance simultaneously
- **Rationale**: Single-user assumption simplifies locking and state management
- **Future Consideration**: Collaborative features if team usage patterns emerge

#### OOS-006: Cost Optimization Engine
- **Description**: Automatically selecting cheaper models or optimizing prompts for cost
- **Rationale**: Premature optimization; users control via configuration
- **Future Consideration**: Agent improvement meta-agent may optimize prompts

#### OOS-007: GUI Installation Wizard
- **Description**: Graphical installer for non-technical users
- **Rationale**: Target audience is CLI-comfortable developers
- **Future Consideration**: Community packages (Homebrew, apt) simplify installation

#### OOS-008: Mobile App
- **Description**: iOS/Android app for monitoring tasks
- **Rationale**: Out of scope for CLI-first tool
- **Future Consideration**: If web dashboard exists, mobile app may follow

## Summary

This requirements specification translates the Abathur product vision into **58 functional requirements** and **30 non-functional requirements** across 8 functional areas:

1. **Template Management**: Foundation for agent configuration
2. **Task Queue Management**: Core persistence and scheduling
3. **Swarm Coordination**: Multi-agent orchestration
4. **Loop Execution**: Iterative refinement workflows
5. **CLI Operations**: User interaction and control
6. **Configuration Management**: Flexible system configuration
7. **Monitoring & Observability**: Transparency and debugging
8. **Agent Improvement**: Self-improving capabilities

Each requirement is traceable to vision goals and use cases, with clear acceptance criteria, priorities, and test strategies. Non-functional requirements ensure the system meets performance, reliability, security, and usability standards expected of production-grade tools.

The specification constrains the system to Python 3.10+, SQLite-based persistence, local-first architecture, and single-node deployment while maintaining flexibility for future distributed scenarios. All decisions align with resolved decision points documented in DECISION_POINTS.md.

This document serves as the contract between stakeholders and the development team, providing the foundation for technical architecture design.

**Document Status:** Complete - Ready for Technical Architecture Phase
**Next Phase:** Technical Architecture Design (to be performed by prd-technical-architect)
**Review Required:** Product vision alignment, requirement completeness, acceptance criteria clarity
