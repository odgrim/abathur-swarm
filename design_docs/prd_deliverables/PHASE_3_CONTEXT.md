## Phase 2 Summary

### Architecture Overview

**4-Layer Architecture:**
```
CLI Interface Layer (Typer)
    ↓
Application Service Layer
    - TemplateManager: Clone, cache, validate templates
    - SwarmOrchestrator: Spawn and coordinate agents
    - LoopExecutor: Iterative refinement loops
    - TaskCoordinator: Queue management and scheduling
    - MonitorManager: Logging, metrics, audit trail
    - ConfigManager: Configuration hierarchy management
    - MetaAgentImprover: Agent performance analysis (future)
    ↓
Core Domain Layer
    - Models: Task, Agent, Queue, ExecutionContext, Result, LoopState
    - Business Rules: Priority 0-10, state transitions, termination conditions
    ↓
Infrastructure Layer
    - QueueRepository: SQLite with ACID transactions
    - StateStore: Shared state with optimistic locking
    - ClaudeClient: Anthropic SDK wrapper with retry logic
    - TemplateRepository: Git cloning with caching
    - Logger: structlog with JSON format
```

**Key Technology Decisions:**
- **Language:** Python 3.10+ (modern type hints, pattern matching)
- **CLI Framework:** Typer 0.9+ (type-safe, built on Click)
- **Persistence:** SQLite 3.35+ (ACID, WAL mode, zero external dependencies)
- **Async Runtime:** asyncio (standard library, I/O multiplexing)
- **Configuration:** YAML files with Pydantic validation + environment variable overrides
- **Logging:** structlog (JSON format, 30-day rotation)
- **Dependency Management:** Poetry (pyproject.toml + poetry.lock)

**Database Schema (5 Tables):**
1. `tasks` - Task queue with priority, status, dependencies, timestamps
2. `agents` - Agent lifecycle tracking with state, resource usage
3. `state` - Shared state key-value store scoped to tasks
4. `audit` - Complete audit trail of all agent actions
5. `metrics` - Performance metrics for cost tracking and optimization

**Directory Structure:**
```
project-root/
├── .claude/                    # Shared with Claude Code
│   ├── agents/*.yaml          # Agent definitions
│   └── mcp.json               # MCP server configurations
├── .abathur/                  # Abathur-specific
│   ├── config.yaml            # Orchestration configuration
│   ├── local.yaml             # Local overrides (gitignored)
│   ├── metadata.json          # Template version metadata
│   ├── abathur.db             # SQLite database
│   └── logs/                  # Log files
└── .env                       # API keys (gitignored)
```

### Core Algorithms

**1. Task Scheduling (O(log n)):**
- Priority queue: 0-10 scale (10 = highest), FIFO tiebreaker
- Dependency resolution with circular dependency detection (DFS, O(n+e))
- Atomic state transitions with optimistic locking

**2. Swarm Coordination:**
- Leader-follower pattern with hierarchical spawning (max depth 3)
- Heartbeat monitoring (30s interval, 3-heartbeat timeout)
- 4 aggregation strategies: concatenate, merge, reduce, vote

**3. Loop Execution:**
- Iterative refinement until convergence or limits
- 5 convergence strategies: threshold, stability, test_pass, custom, LLM_judge
- Checkpoint after each iteration for crash recovery

**4. Failure Recovery:**
- Exponential backoff: 10s → 5min, 3 retry attempts
- Dead letter queue (DLQ) for permanently failed tasks
- Checkpoint restoration for interrupted loops

**5. Resource Management:**
- Adaptive concurrency control based on memory/CPU
- Memory limits: 512MB per agent, 4GB total (configurable)
- Monitoring: 80% warning, 90% garbage collection, 100% termination

**6. Agent Lifecycle State Machine:**
- States: SPAWNING → IDLE → BUSY → TERMINATING → TERMINATED (with FAILED path)
- Optimistic locking for state transitions
- Heartbeat-based health monitoring

| Queue Scalability | 10,000 tasks | SQLite B-tree + pagination |
| Persistence | >99.9% | SQLite ACID + WAL mode |
| Startup Time | <500ms | Typer framework |
| Memory Overhead | <200MB | Budget allocation validated |

## Security Context for Security Specialist

### Current Security Design

**API Key Management:**
- **Primary:** System keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service)
- **Fallback:** Encrypted .env file with AES-256
- **Precedence:** Environment variable > Keychain > .env file
- **Requirement:** Never log API keys, even in --debug mode

**Data Protection:**
- **At Rest:** SQLite database unencrypted (local-first assumption)
- **In Transit:** HTTPS for Claude API, GitHub template cloning
- **Logging:** Structured JSON logs, API keys redacted, 30-day retention
- **Audit Trail:** Complete history of all agent actions (90-day retention)

**Input Validation:**
- **Configuration:** Pydantic schema validation for all YAML/JSON
- **User Inputs:** Type validation via Typer, range checks (priority 0-10)
- **Template Validation:** Structure validation, YAML syntax checking
- **SQL Injection:** Parameterized queries via SQLite

**Template Security:**
- **Source:** GitHub repository (odgrim/abathur-claude-template)
- **Validation:** Structure validation, required file checks
- **Versioning:** Git tags/releases for template versions
- **Risk:** Malicious templates could execute arbitrary code (mitigate with validation, sandboxing)

### Security Requirements to Define

1. **Threat Model:**
   - Identify threat actors (malicious users, compromised templates, supply chain attacks)
   - Define attack vectors (template injection, SQL injection, path traversal, API key theft)
   - Assess impact of successful attacks (data exfiltration, resource exhaustion, credential theft)

2. **Security Controls:**
   - Template integrity verification (checksums, signatures)
   - Sandboxing for agent execution (filesystem access restrictions, network isolation)
   - Rate limiting for API calls (prevent abuse)
   - Audit log integrity (tamper detection)

3. **Compliance Considerations:**
   - Data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) for audit logs
   - API usage policies (Anthropic terms of service)
   - Open source licensing (MIT/Apache 2.0 compatibility)
   - Security best practices (OWASP, CWE)

4. **Dependency Security:**
   - Audit all dependencies for known vulnerabilities (Safety, Bandit)
   - Establish vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
   - Define update policy for security patches

5. **Operational Security:**
   - Secure development practices (code review, static analysis)
   - Incident response procedures (compromised API keys, data breaches)
   - Security documentation for users (API key management, template validation)

   - Optimization targets (query optimization, caching, connection pooling)
   - Technical debt tracking (code smells, refactoring opportunities)
   - User feedback integration (issue tracking, feature requests)
