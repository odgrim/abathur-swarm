**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks (4 sequential phases with validation checkpoints)

**Success Criteria:**
- All PRD requirements have corresponding technical specifications
- Specifications are implementation-ready (unambiguous, detailed, actionable)
- 100% traceability from PRD to technical specs
- Validation gates pass at each phase
- Complete developer documentation and implementation guide

## 3. Agent Team Design

### Team Composition

I've created a specialized team of **10 agents** covering all technical areas:

#### Core Management (1 agent)
1. **tech-specs-orchestrator** (Sonnet) - Coordinates development, validates phases, ensures completeness

#### Foundational Design (2 agents)
2. **database-schema-architect** (Sonnet) - Database schema, DDL, indexes, normalization
3. **python-architecture-specialist** (Sonnet) - Clean architecture, SOLID principles, module design

#### Implementation Specifications (3 agents)
4. **algorithm-design-specialist** (Thinking) - Algorithm design, complexity analysis, pseudocode
5. **api-integration-specialist** (Thinking) - External API integrations, retry logic, error handling
6. **cli-implementation-specialist** (Thinking) - CLI commands, validation, output formatting

#### Quality & Operations (3 agents)
7. **testing-strategy-specialist** (Sonnet) - Testing strategy, test specs, CI/CD integration
8. **config-management-specialist** (Sonnet) - Configuration system, Pydantic models, validation
9. **deployment-packaging-specialist** (Sonnet) - PyPI, Docker, Homebrew, cross-platform

#### Documentation (1 agent)
10. **documentation-specialist** (Haiku) - Technical docs, implementation guide, examples

### Agent Specialization Rationale

**Why Thinking (Claude 3.5 Sonnet with extended thinking):**
- Algorithm design requires deep reasoning and complexity analysis
- API integration needs careful error scenario modeling
- CLI implementation involves complex validation logic design

**Why Sonnet (Claude 3.5 Sonnet):**
- Architecture and design work benefits from high-level reasoning
- Review and orchestration requires strong analysis capabilities
- Testing and configuration design needs systematic thinking

**Why Haiku (Claude 3 Haiku):**
- Documentation is content creation, not complex reasoning
- Cost-effective for large documentation output
- Fast turnaround for iterative documentation refinement

### Agent Tools Assignment

Each agent has tools appropriate to their role:

**Orchestrator:**
- Read, Grep, Glob (analyze PRD documents)
- Write (compile final specifications)
- Task (invoke other agents)
- TodoWrite (track progress)

**Specialists:**
- Read (access PRD and prior agent outputs)
- Write (create specification documents)
- Grep, Glob (search existing documents)
- WebFetch (for api-integration-specialist to check latest API docs)

## 5. Orchestration Strategy

### Phase-Based Execution

The agent team executes in **4 sequential phases** with **mandatory validation gates**:

#### Phase 1: Data & Architecture Modeling (Week 1)
**Goal:** Define foundational structures

**Agents:**
1. database-schema-architect → Database schema with DDL
2. python-architecture-specialist → Application architecture
3. tech-specs-orchestrator → **VALIDATION GATE** (go/no-go decision)

**Validation Criteria:**
- All entities from PRD modeled in database
- 3NF normalization achieved
- Python architecture has clean layers
- No circular dependencies
- Interface protocols defined

#### Phase 2: Implementation Specifications (Weeks 2-3)
**Goal:** Detailed specifications for core implementations

**Agents:**
4. algorithm-design-specialist → Algorithms with complexity analysis
5. api-integration-specialist → API integrations with error handling
6. cli-implementation-specialist → CLI commands with validation
7. tech-specs-orchestrator → **VALIDATION GATE** (go/no-go decision)

**Validation Criteria:**
- All algorithms have pseudocode and complexity analysis
- Performance targets achievable with designed algorithms
- All external APIs covered with retry logic
- All CLI commands specified with validation rules

#### Phase 3: Quality, Configuration & Deployment (Week 3-4)
**Goal:** Complete operational specifications

**Agents:**
8. testing-strategy-specialist → Testing strategy
9. config-management-specialist → Configuration system
10. deployment-packaging-specialist → Deployment strategies
11. tech-specs-orchestrator → **VALIDATION GATE** (go/no-go decision)

**Validation Criteria:**
- Testing strategy achieves >80% coverage target
- All config parameters validated with Pydantic
- Deployment covers all platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Installation time <5min target feasible

#### Phase 4: Documentation & Compilation (Week 4)
**Goal:** Comprehensive documentation and final compilation

**Agents:**
12. documentation-specialist → Technical documentation
13. tech-specs-orchestrator → **FINAL COMPILATION** (completeness validation)

**Validation Criteria:**
- All specifications documented clearly
- Examples provided for complex concepts
- Traceability matrix shows 100% PRD coverage
- No ambiguous statements
- Implementation-ready (developers can begin coding)

### Validation Gate Protocol

At each validation gate, the orchestrator:

1. **Reviews Deliverables:**
   - Verify all expected files created
   - Check completeness and quality
   - Assess clarity and implementation-readiness

2. **Validates Alignment:**
   - Ensure PRD requirements covered
   - Check consistency across specifications
   - Identify gaps or contradictions

3. **Assesses Integration:**
   - Verify interfaces align between components
   - Check dependency correctness
   - Validate performance feasibility

4. **Makes Decision:**
   - **APPROVE:** Proceed to next phase
   - **CONDITIONAL:** Proceed with monitoring of identified issues
   - **REVISE:** Return to agents for refinement
   - **ESCALATE:** Fundamental problem requires human review

### Context Passing Strategy

Each agent receives focused context:

**Input Context:**
- Relevant PRD documents (not entire PRD, only sections needed)
- Outputs from prerequisite agents
- Specific task description with acceptance criteria
- Success criteria (measurable outcomes)

**Output Format:**
Standardized JSON response with:
- Execution status (success/partial/failure)
- Deliverables (files created, specifications completed)
- Orchestration context (dependencies resolved, blockers, next steps)
- Quality metrics (coverage, completeness, validation results)
- Human-readable summary

This enables the orchestrator to make informed decisions about phase progression.
