## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **OAuth API instability**: Mitigation - Design abstraction layer, support multiple methods
- **Token management complexity**: Mitigation - Delegate to official SDKs where possible
- **Integration breaking changes**: Mitigation - Comprehensive testing, feature flags

### Timeline Risks
- **Underestimated complexity**: Mitigation - Include buffer time, iterative refinement
- **Waiting for human decisions**: Mitigation - Front-load DECISION_POINTS.md resolution

### Quality Risks
- **Incomplete research**: Mitigation - Multiple research sources, validation gate
- **Inconsistent requirements**: Mitigation - Orchestrator ensures cross-phase consistency

---

## Success Metrics

### Process Metrics
- All phases completed with APPROVE decision
- Zero ESCALATE decisions (all blockers resolved)
- DECISION_POINTS.md fully resolved before Phase 2

### Deliverable Metrics
- PRD covers all OAuth methods discovered
- Architecture design addresses all requirements
- Security design has zero critical gaps
- Implementation roadmap has clear milestones

### Quality Metrics
- PRD is implementable without additional research
- All agents deliver on first attempt (no rework phases)
- Human stakeholder approves final PRD

---

## Emergency Procedures

### If Agent Fails to Deliver
1. Orchestrator reviews agent output
2. Identifies specific gaps or issues
3. Re-invokes agent with refined context and specific gap-filling instructions
4. If second attempt fails, ESCALATE to human

### If Phase Validation Fails
- **CONDITIONAL**: Minor issues identified, proceed with monitoring and adjustments
- **REVISE**: Return to phase, re-invoke relevant agents with corrective instructions
- **ESCALATE**: Fundamental blockers require human oversight

### If DECISION_POINTS.md Incomplete
- PAUSE all implementation-related work
- Document additional decision points discovered
- ESCALATE to human for resolution
- Resume once decisions resolved
