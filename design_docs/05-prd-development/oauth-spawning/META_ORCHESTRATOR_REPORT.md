# Meta-Project-Orchestrator Report
## OAuth-Based Agent Spawning Architecture PRD

**Project**: Comprehensive PRD for OAuth-based agent spawning in Abathur
**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Agent team created, orchestration plan complete, ready for human decision resolution

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive agent team design, orchestration strategy, and research findings for developing a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for adding OAuth-based agent spawning capabilities to the Abathur hivemind swarm management system.

**Current State**: Abathur uses Claude Agent SDK with API key authentication (x-api-key header, sk-ant-... format)

**Desired State**: Dual-mode authentication supporting both API keys AND OAuth-based methods (Claude Code CLI, Agent SDK OAuth, etc.) to leverage Claude Max subscriptions

**Key Challenge**: OAuth tokens cannot be used as API keys - they serve different purposes and require different interaction mechanisms

**Solution Approach**: Design abstraction layer supporting multiple agent spawning implementations with configuration-driven mode selection

---

## Research Findings Summary

### OAuth-Based Claude Interaction Methods Discovered

Based on comprehensive web research conducted during this meta-orchestration phase, the following OAuth-based interaction methods were identified:

#### 1. Claude Code CLI Subshell Invocation
**Description**: Programmatically invoke `claude` CLI tool with OAuth authentication

**Capabilities**:
- Supports `claude -p "prompt" --json` for programmatic access
- JSON output for structured responses
- Full Claude Code features (subagents, tools, MCP)
- Can spawn sub-agents via Task tool
- Supports streaming and non-streaming modes

**Rate Limits**:
- Max 5x ($100/month): ~50-200 prompts per 5 hours
- Max 20x ($200/month): ~200-800 prompts per 5 hours
- Shared with web claude.ai usage

**Context Window**: 200K tokens (subscription models)

**Authentication**: OAuth via browser flow, tokens managed by Claude Code

**Limitations**:
- Requires Claude Code CLI installation
- Subshell overhead for each invocation
- Sub-agents cannot spawn additional sub-agents (depth=1 limitation)
- OAuth authentication issues reported in 2025 (config persistence problems)

**Pros**:
- Leverages Max subscription (no API charges)
- Official Anthropic tool with full feature support
- Includes MCP integration capabilities

**Cons**:
- Less portable than pure Python SDK
- OAuth flow can be problematic (GitHub issues #1484, #3498, #5975)
- Requires external process management

#### 2. Claude Agent SDK (Official Python Package)
**Description**: Official `claude-agent-sdk` Python package (formerly claude-code-sdk, deprecated Sep 2025)

**Capabilities**:
- Programmatic Python API for agent creation
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE support (implemented July 2025)
- Custom tools and hooks as Python functions
- MCP protocol support for standardized integrations
- Streaming and non-streaming execution

**Rate Limits**:
- Depends on authentication method (API key vs OAuth)
- OAuth: Subject to Max subscription limits (50-200 or 200-800 per 5 hours)

**Context Window**:
- API Key (Sonnet 4.5): 1M tokens
- OAuth/Subscription: 200K tokens

**Authentication**:
- Supports both API keys and OAuth tokens
- OAuth via `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` environment variable
- OAuth flow can be clunky in containers (recommended: long-lived access tokens)

**Limitations**:
- OAuth token lifecycle management complexity
- Different context windows based on auth method

**Pros**:
- Official Anthropic SDK with Python-native API
- Supports both API key and OAuth authentication
- MCP integration for external services

**Cons**:
- OAuth token management overhead
- Smaller context window when using OAuth (200K vs 1M)

#### 3. claude_max Community Tool
**Description**: Community-created workaround for programmatic Claude Max subscription access

**Capabilities**:
- Fixes authentication flaw in Claude Code preventing programmatic Max usage
- Enables `--print` flag to work with Max subscriptions
- Prevents "Credit balance too low" errors for subscription users

**Authentication**:
- Workaround removes conflicting environment variables to force fallback auth
- Script saved to `~/.local/bin/claude_max`

**Limitations**:
- Unofficial tool, potential breaking changes
- Maintenance depends on community
- Workaround nature suggests fragility

**Pros**:
- Proven solution for programmatic Max access
- Addresses specific Claude Code authentication bug

**Cons**:
- Not officially supported by Anthropic
- May break with Claude Code updates
- Security implications of workarounds unclear

#### 4. Model Context Protocol (MCP) with OAuth
**Description**: Standardized protocol for AI-to-service integrations with OAuth support

**Capabilities**:
- OAuth 2.1 implementation with PKCE
- Server-side OAuth authentication for MCP servers
- Dynamic client registration (RFC7591)
- Authorization Server Metadata (RFC8414)
- Resource Indicators (RFC8707)

**Authentication**:
- MCP servers act as OAuth Resource Servers
- Clients implement OAuth 2.1 for public clients
- Support for Authorization Code and Client Credentials grants

**Limitations**:
- Focused on service integration, not direct Claude interaction
- Requires MCP server infrastructure
- Complex for simple agent spawning use case

**Pros**:
- Standardized OAuth protocol
- Handles authentication for external services automatically
- Production-ready (Atlassian Remote MCP Server deployed)

**Cons**:
- Overkill for simple agent spawning
- Additional infrastructure complexity
- Primarily for external service auth, not Claude API auth

#### 5. Third-Party GitHub Actions Integration
**Description**: Community forks enabling OAuth for Claude Code in CI/CD pipelines

**Capabilities**:
- OAuth authentication in GitHub Actions workflows
- Enables Claude Max subscribers to use subscription in automation

**Authentication**: OAuth flow adapted for GitHub Actions environment

**Limitations**:
- Specific to GitHub Actions use case
- Community-maintained forks

**Pros**: Enables CI/CD automation with Max subscriptions

**Cons**: Limited to GitHub Actions, not general-purpose

### Comparative Analysis

| Method | Official? | Context Window | Rate Limits | Ease of Integration | Stability |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Claude Code CLI | Yes | 200K | 50-800/5h | Medium (subshell) | Medium (OAuth issues) |
| Agent SDK OAuth | Yes | 200K | 50-800/5h | High (Python native) | High (official) |
| Agent SDK API Key | Yes | 1M | Pay-per-token | High (Python native) | High (official) |
| claude_max | No | 200K | 50-800/5h | Low (workaround) | Low (unofficial) |
| MCP OAuth | Yes | N/A | N/A | Low (complex infra) | High (standard) |

### Key Insight: OAuth Tokens vs API Keys

**CRITICAL FINDING**: OAuth tokens for Claude Code are "only authorized for use with Claude Code and cannot be used for other API requests" (from search results)

This means:
1. OAuth tokens CANNOT be passed to Anthropic API as x-api-key headers
2. OAuth-based spawning REQUIRES using Claude Code CLI or Agent SDK OAuth flows
3. Direct API endpoint calls with OAuth tokens will fail
4. Different interaction paradigm from API key approach

**Implication for Abathur**: Must implement separate spawning mechanisms for OAuth vs API key, not just credential swapping

---

## Current Abathur Architecture Analysis

### Agent Spawning Flow (API Key Mode)

**Current Components**:
1. **ClaudeClient** (`src/abathur/application/claude_client.py`)
   - Wraps Anthropic and AsyncAnthropic clients
   - Takes API key via constructor or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var
   - Provides `execute_task()` and `stream_task()` methods
   - Uses Anthropic SDK's `messages.create()` API

2. **AgentExecutor** (`src/abathur/application/agent_executor.py`)
   - Loads agent definitions from YAML files (`.claude/agents/`)
   - Creates Agent domain objects
   - Builds system prompts and user messages
   - Invokes ClaudeClient to execute tasks
   - Manages agent lifecycle (SPAWNING -> IDLE -> BUSY -> TERMINATING -> TERMINATED)

3. **ConfigManager** (`src/abathur/infrastructure/config.py`)
   - Hierarchical configuration loading
   - API key retrieval from env, keychain, or .env file
   - Secure credential storage via system keyring

**Current Authentication Flow**:
```
User -> ConfigManager.get_api_key() -> Environment/Keychain/.env
     -> ClaudeClient(api_key) -> Anthropic SDK -> API (x-api-key header)
```

### Integration Points for OAuth Spawning

**Key Locations for Modification**:

1. **Abstract Spawner Layer** (NEW)
   - Create `AgentSpawner` ABC with `spawn_agent()` method
   - `ApiKeyAgentSpawner` - existing Anthropic SDK approach
   - `OAuthCliAgentSpawner` - Claude Code CLI subshell
   - `OAuthSdkAgentSpawner` - Agent SDK with OAuth tokens

2. **ClaudeClient Enhancement**
   - Add constructor parameter: `auth_mode` (api_key | oauth_cli | oauth_sdk)
   - Implement OAuth-specific execution paths
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing API key approach

3. **ConfigManager Extension**
   - Add OAuth token storage methods
   - Add `get_auth_mode()` method
   - Support OAuth credential hierarchical loading
   - Secure OAuth token encryption at rest

4. **AgentExecutor Modification**
   - Use spawner factory pattern to select implementation
   - Pass auth mode to spawner selection logic
   - Maintain existing interface for backward compatibility

**Architectural Impact**:
- Minimal changes to existing components (abstraction layer isolates changes)
- Clean Architecture maintained (new spawners in Application layer)
- Backward compatibility preserved (existing API key flow unchanged)
- Extensible design (new OAuth methods can be added as new spawner implementations)

## Orchestration Strategy

### Agent Chaining with Phase Validation

**Critical Enhancement**: Mandatory validation gates prevent proceeding with incomplete or low-quality deliverables

**Validation Decision Matrix**:
- **APPROVE**: All deliverables meet quality criteria, proceed to next phase
- **CONDITIONAL**: Minor issues noted, proceed with monitoring and adjustments
- **REVISE**: Significant gaps identified, return agents to address deficiencies
- **ESCALATE**: Fundamental blockers requiring human oversight

**Context Passing Protocol**:
Each agent receives:
1. Project overview and objectives
2. Current phase and their specific role
3. Outputs from all previous agents (file paths)
4. Relevant decisions from DECISION_POINTS.md
5. Specific deliverables expected
6. Success criteria for validation

**Orchestrator Responsibilities**:
1. Invoke agents in correct sequence
2. Validate outputs at phase boundaries
3. Generate refined context for next phase
4. Track progress with TodoWrite
5. Consolidate deliverables
6. Escalate blockers to human

**Stateless Agent Architecture**:
- Agents are "pure functions" with discrete inputs and outputs
- No persistent state between invocations
- All coordination via orchestrator
- Outputs are self-contained and complete

---

## Key Recommendations

### 1. Prioritize Official OAuth Methods

**Recommendation**: Focus PRD on Claude Agent SDK OAuth (official, supported) as primary OAuth approach, with Claude Code CLI as secondary option.

**Rationale**:
- Agent SDK is officially maintained by Anthropic
- Python-native integration with Abathur
- Proven OAuth 2.0 with PKCE implementation (July 2025)
- Lower risk than community workarounds

**Secondary**: Claude Code CLI for users who prefer Max subscription usage patterns

**Avoid**: claude_max (unofficial), custom OAuth flows (high complexity)

### 2. Design for Extensibility

**Recommendation**: Use abstract AgentSpawner interface with multiple implementations

**Rationale**:
- New OAuth methods can be added without modifying existing code
- Clean separation of concerns
- Testable in isolation
- Easy to deprecate methods that become obsolete

**Pattern**:
```python
class AgentSpawner(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def spawn_agent(self, task: Task) -> Result:
        pass

class ApiKeyAgentSpawner(AgentSpawner):
    # Existing Anthropic SDK approach
    pass

class OAuthSdkAgentSpawner(AgentSpawner):
    # Claude Agent SDK with OAuth
    pass

class OAuthCliAgentSpawner(AgentSpawner):
    # Claude Code CLI subshell
    pass
```

### 3. Maintain Backward Compatibility

**Recommendation**: Ensure existing Abathur deployments work without changes

**Rationale**:
- Zero migration burden for existing users
- Gradual adoption of OAuth features
- Reduces deployment risk

**Implementation**:
- Default to API key if no OAuth configured
- Existing environment variables continue to work
- No breaking changes to public APIs

### 4. Delegate Token Management

**Recommendation**: Let official SDKs/tools manage OAuth token lifecycle

**Rationale**:
- Reduces complexity in Abathur
- Leverages official token refresh implementations
- Lower security risk (tokens managed by experts)

**Implementation**:
- Agent SDK OAuth: Delegate to SDK's token management
- Claude Code CLI: Delegate to CLI's OAuth flow
- Minimal token storage in Abathur (reference only)

### 5. Front-Load Decision Resolution

**Recommendation**: Complete all DECISION_POINTS.md before agent work begins

**Rationale**:
- Prevents agent blockers during execution
- Reduces rework from changing decisions mid-implementation
- Faster overall project completion

**Process**:
1. Human reviews all 14 decision points
2. Fills in decisions based on requirements
3. Marks document as RESOLVED
4. Then and only then, kick off agent orchestration

### 6. Implement Comprehensive Observability

**Recommendation**: Track metrics separately for each auth mode

**Rationale**:
- Understand usage patterns across modes
- Identify performance differences
- Support troubleshooting auth-specific issues

**Metrics**:
- Authentication success/failure rates per mode
- Token usage per mode
- Latency per mode
- Error types per mode

### 7. Plan for Rate Limit Differences

**Recommendation**: Implement usage tracking and warnings for OAuth modes

**Rationale**:
- OAuth has fixed limits (50-200 or 200-800 per 5h window)
- API key has pay-per-token model (no hard limits)
- Users need visibility into approaching limits

**Implementation**:
- Track usage per auth mode
- Warn when approaching OAuth limits
- Optional: Smart scheduling to defer tasks when limit reached

---

## Decision Points Requiring Human Input

The following 14 decision points MUST be resolved before PRD development begins (see DECISION_POINTS.md for full details):

1. **OAuth Method Selection** - Which OAuth methods to support (CLI, SDK, both?)
2. **Authentication Mode Configuration** - How users select mode (auto-detect, env var, config file?)
3. **OAuth Token Storage** - Where to store tokens (keychain, encrypted file, delegate to SDK?)
4. **Token Refresh Strategy** - How to handle expiration (manual, automatic, delegate?)
5. **Backward Compatibility** - Migration approach for existing deployments
6. **Rate Limiting** - How to handle different limits across auth modes
7. **Context Window Handling** - Different windows for API key (1M) vs OAuth (200K)
8. **Model Selection** - How to handle model availability differences
9. **Testing Strategy** - OAuth testing in CI/CD vs manual
10. **Error Handling** - Fallback behavior when OAuth fails
11. **Multi-User Support** - Single user vs multi-tenant design
12. **Observability** - Metrics and logging requirements
13. **Documentation** - What docs to deliver
14. **Deployment** - Packaging and versioning approach

**Status**: All marked as PENDING in DECISION_POINTS.md

**Next Action**: Human reviews and completes all decision points before using KICKOFF_PROMPT.md
