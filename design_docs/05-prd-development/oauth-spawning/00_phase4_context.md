## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Goal

Add OAuth-based authentication to Abathur's agent spawning system, enabling users to spawn Claude agents using:
- **API Key Authentication** (existing, 1M token context window)
- **OAuth Authentication** (new, 200K token context window, leverages Claude Max subscription)

### 1.2 Key Constraints

**Technical**:
- Zero breaking changes to existing API key workflows
- Clean Architecture principles preserved (no changes to core orchestration layer)
- SDK OAuth support verified (`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable)
- Token refresh endpoint community-confirmed (`https://console.anthropic.com/v1/oauth/token`)

**Scope**:
- Implementation: ~600 LOC new/modified code
- Timeline: 4 weeks (110 developer hours)
- Testing: ~600 LOC tests (1:1 ratio)
- MVP excludes: Interactive OAuth flow, rate limit tracking, browser-based authentication

**Security**:
- All 5 NFR-SEC requirements met (AES-256 encryption, zero token logging, HTTPS-only transmission, etc.)
- Comprehensive threat model (STRIDE analysis, 10 critical threats identified)
- Production-ready incident response plan (P0-P3 categories)

- Context window constraint identified: 200K tokens (OAuth) vs 1M tokens (API key)

**Deliverable 2: Current Architecture Analysis (02_current_architecture.md)**
- Abathur follows Clean Architecture (domain, application, infrastructure, CLI layers)
- API key authentication currently hardcoded in ClaudeClient
- **Refactoring Need**: Extract authentication into abstraction layer
- Integration points identified: ClaudeClient (MAJOR), ConfigManager (MODERATE), CLI (MODERATE)

### 2.2 Phase 2: Requirements & Architecture

## 3. Key Findings from Phase 3 Validation

### 3.1 Strengths (Commendable)

1. **Security Architecture Comprehensiveness**:
   - STRIDE threat model is textbook-quality
   - Penetration testing plan with 10 scenarios exceeds typical PRD depth
   - Incident response plan is production-ready (P0-P3 categories, 6-phase procedure)
   - Audit logging with 16 security events provides excellent observability

2. **Implementation Roadmap Realism**:
   - 4-week timeline is achievable with 18-hour buffer (16%)
   - Task granularity (2-10 hours) indicates realistic estimation
   - Risk assessment identifies 10 risks with concrete mitigations (no "TBD" mitigations)
   - Testing strategy with 90% coverage target is ambitious but achievable

3. **Security ↔ Roadmap Alignment**:
   - All 5 NFR-SEC requirements have implementation tasks and test coverage
   - All 10 penetration testing scenarios mapped to roadmap tasks
   - Incident response procedures have corresponding monitoring/alerting in deployment plan

4. **Phase 1-2 Integration**:
   - Zero conflicts with previous phase deliverables
   - All architectural decisions from Phase 2 implemented in Phase 3
   - DECISION_POINTS.md resolutions consistently reflected

5. **Documentation Quality**:
   - Structured, professional formatting throughout
   - Clear section numbering and cross-references
   - Code examples where appropriate (security, roadmap)
   - Tables and diagrams enhance readability

### 3.2 Minor Observations (Not Blockers)

1. **Community-Confirmed Endpoints**:
   - Token refresh endpoint (`https://console.anthropic.com/v1/oauth/token`) is community-confirmed, not officially documented
   - Mitigation: Fallback to manual re-authentication, monitoring for endpoint changes
   - Assessment: Acceptable risk with fallback strategy

2. **Rate Limit Tracking Deferred to Post-MVP**:
   - Usage tracking for OAuth rate limits (50-200 prompts/5h) deferred to post-MVP
   - Justification: Clear 429 error messages provide user feedback, complexity not justified for MVP
   - Assessment: Reasonable scope management decision

3. **Interactive OAuth Flow Not Implemented**:
   - Browser-based OAuth flow deferred to post-MVP, manual token input only in MVP
   - Justification: Manual input reduces MVP scope, interactive flow is enhancement
   - Assessment: Appropriate for MVP, clearly documented as future enhancement

## 4. Critical Decisions and Constraints

### 4.1 Resolved Architectural Decisions

From DECISION_POINTS.md (14 decision points resolved):

| Decision Point | Resolution | Impact |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| **OAuth Method Selection** | Claude Agent SDK with OAuth token support | Primary method, SDK verified working with `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` |
| **Authentication Mode Configuration** | Auto-detection by credential prefix | Detect "sk-ant-api" prefix for API key, else OAuth |
| **OAuth Token Storage** | OS keychain (primary), environment variables (fallback) | Secure, persistent, cloud-compatible |
| **Token Refresh and Lifecycle** | Automatic refresh (proactive + reactive) | Proactive: 5 min before expiry, Reactive: on 401 |
| **Backward Compatibility** | Fully backward compatible | Zero breaking changes, API key workflows preserved |
| **Context Window Handling** | Auto-detection with warnings | 200K (OAuth) vs 1M (API key), warn at 90% threshold |
| **Error Handling and Fallback** | Retry OAuth 3 times, then fail with clear message | No automatic fallback to API key (prevent unexpected billing) |
| **Observability and Monitoring** | All authentication events logged | 16 security events, structured JSON logging |

### 4.2 Technical Constraints

**SDK Constraints**:
- Anthropic SDK (^0.18.0) supports `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable
- SDK uses Bearer token authentication when `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` is set
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` takes precedence if both are set
- No built-in token refresh mechanism in SDK (must be implemented in ClaudeClient)

**Token Refresh Endpoint**:
- URL: `https://console.anthropic.com/v1/oauth/token`
- Request format: JSON with `grant_type=refresh_token`, `refresh_token=<token>`, `client_id=9d1c250a-e61b-44d9-88ed-5944d1962f5e`
- Response format: JSON with `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `expires_in`
- Source: Community-confirmed (Claude Code CLI implementation), not officially documented
- Fallback: Manual re-authentication if refresh fails

**Context Window Limits**:
- API Key (Sonnet 4.5): 1,000,000 tokens
- OAuth (Max 5x/20x): 200,000 tokens
- Warning threshold: 90% of limit (180K for OAuth, 900K for API key)
- Estimation method: 4 characters ≈ 1 token (approximate)

### 4.3 Security Requirements

**NFR-SEC Requirements** (all met):

| ID | Requirement | Implementation | Validation |
|----|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| **NFR-SEC-001** | AES-256 encrypted token storage | OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service) | Encryption verification tests |
| **NFR-SEC-002** | Zero token logging (0 occurrences) | Structured logging with credential redaction | Automated log scanning |
| **NFR-SEC-003** | Error message sanitization (0 credentials) | Custom exception hierarchy with remediation | Exception sanitization tests |
| **NFR-SEC-004** | HTTPS-only token transmission (100%) | TLS 1.3+, certificate validation | Network traffic monitoring |
| **NFR-SEC-005** | Token revocation on logout (<100ms) | Multi-location cleanup (keychain + env vars + .env) | Cleanup verification tests |

### 5.2 Terminology Standardization

**Consistent Terms** (use these throughout PRD):

| Term | Definition | Source |
|------|------------|--------|
| **OAuth authentication** | Authentication using OAuth access tokens with Bearer header | All deliverables |
| **API key authentication** | Authentication using long-lived API keys with x-api-key header | All deliverables |
| **Token lifecycle** | 5 stages: acquisition, storage, refresh, usage, revocation | 04, 05, 06 |
| **Context window** | Maximum token limit per request (200K OAuth, 1M API key) | 03, 04, 05, 06 |
| **AuthProvider abstraction** | Interface-based authentication with 2 implementations | 04, 06 |
| **Proactive refresh** | Token refresh 5 minutes before expiry | 04, 05, 06 |
| **Reactive refresh** | Token refresh triggered by 401 Unauthorized response | 04, 05, 06 |
| **NFR-SEC-001 to NFR-SEC-005** | Non-functional security requirements (encryption, logging, HTTPS, cleanup) | 03, 04, 05, 06 |

**Avoid Inconsistent Terms**:
- "OAuth token" vs "access token" → Use "OAuth access token" or "access token" consistently
- "Token refresh" vs "credential refresh" → Use "token refresh"
- "Keychain" vs "OS keychain" vs "system keychain" → Use "OS keychain"

### 5.3 Cross-References

**Key Cross-References to Maintain**:

1. **Requirements ↔ Architecture**:
   - FR-AUTH-001 (dual-mode authentication) → Section 4: AuthProvider abstraction
   - FR-TOKEN-001 (automatic refresh) → Section 4: OAuthAuthProvider implementation
   - NFR-SEC-001 (AES-256 encryption) → Section 5: Encryption strategy

2. **Architecture ↔ Security**:
   - AuthProvider interface → Section 5: Security controls (authentication abstraction)
   - Token lifecycle → Section 5: Threat model (5-stage analysis)
   - ConfigManager OAuth methods → Section 5: Encryption strategy (keychain storage)

3. **Security ↔ Implementation**:
   - NFR-SEC-001 to NFR-SEC-005 → Section 6: Implementation tasks (Week 1-4)
   - Penetration testing scenarios → Section 6: Testing strategy (security tests)
   - Incident response plan → Section 6: Deployment checklist (post-deployment monitoring)

4. **Requirements ↔ Implementation**:
   - All 30 FRs → Section 6: Implementation tasks (Week 1-4 deliverables)
   - All 31 NFRs → Section 6: Success metrics (development, adoption, performance)

### 5.4 Redundancy Elimination

**Sections to Consolidate** (avoid duplication):

1. **Token Lifecycle**:
   - Appears in: 04 (System Architecture - Section 4), 05 (Security Architecture - Section 2.3), 06 (Implementation Roadmap - Section 2)
   - **Consolidate**: Primary description in Section 4 (Architecture), reference in Section 5 (Security) for threat analysis, reference in Section 6 (Implementation) for tasks

2. **Context Window Management**:
   - Appears in: 03 (Requirements - FR-CONTEXT), 04 (System Architecture - Section 8), 06 (Implementation Roadmap - W3-T3)
   - **Consolidate**: Primary description in Section 4 (Architecture), reference in Section 3 (Requirements) for FR-CONTEXT, reference in Section 6 (Implementation) for tasks

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Appears in: 03 (Requirements - FR-ERROR), 04 (System Architecture - Section 6), 06 (Implementation Roadmap - W1-T4)
   - **Consolidate**: Primary description in Section 4 (Architecture), reference in Section 3 (Requirements) for FR-ERROR, reference in Section 6 (Implementation) for exception hierarchy task

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Appears in: 05 (Security Architecture - Section 4), 06 (Implementation Roadmap - Section 6)
   - **Consolidate**: Combine into single Section 6 (Implementation Plan - Testing Strategy), include both general testing (06) and security-specific testing (05)

### 5.5 Formatting Guidelines

**Professional Formatting**:
- Use Markdown headers (## for major sections, ### for subsections)
- Tables for structured data (requirements, risks, metrics, etc.)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting for code examples
- Mermaid diagrams for architecture diagrams (convert ASCII diagrams if possible)
- Numbered lists for sequential steps (implementation phases, testing procedures)
- Bullet lists for non-sequential items (features, risks, etc.)

**Section Numbering**:
- Level 1: 1. Executive Summary, 2. Background and Research, etc.
- Level 2: 3.1 Functional Requirements, 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements, etc.
- Level 3: 3.1.1 FR-AUTH, 3.1.2 FR-TOKEN, etc.

**Cross-Reference Format**:
- Within document: "See Section 4.2 (AuthProvider Abstraction) for details"
- To requirements: "Implements FR-AUTH-001 (dual-mode authentication)"
- To NFRs: "Meets NFR-SEC-001 (AES-256 encrypted token storage)"
