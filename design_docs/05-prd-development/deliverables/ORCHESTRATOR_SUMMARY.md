- Constraints and assumptions documentation

---

## Phase 1 Validation Gate Criteria

When both Phase 1 deliverables are complete, the orchestrator will perform a comprehensive validation review:

### Completeness Checks
- Vision document contains all required sections (vision, personas, use cases, journeys, value prop, metrics)
- Requirements document contains all required sections (FR, NFR, acceptance criteria, traceability)
- All use cases have corresponding functional requirements
- All requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- Traceability matrix is complete

### Consistency Checks
- Vision aligns with project objectives and constraints
- Requirements fully support all documented use cases
- No contradictions between vision and requirements
- Architectural decisions from DECISION_POINTS.md reflected in requirements
- Performance targets incorporated into NFRs

### Quality Checks
- Vision is clear, compelling, and actionable
- User personas are well-defined and realistic
- Use cases are comprehensive and cover primary workflows
- Requirements are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Acceptance criteria are testable
- Success metrics are measurable and aligned with business goals

### Actionability Checks
- Requirements provide sufficient detail for Phase 2 architecture design
- Use cases can be traced to implementation features
- Constraints are clearly documented and justified
- Assumptions are explicit and validated

### Validation Decision Matrix

**APPROVE:** All validation criteria met → Proceed immediately to Phase 2
- Generate Phase 2 invocation context
- Prepare technical architect agent
- No revisions needed

**CONDITIONAL:** Minor issues identified → Proceed to Phase 2 with adjustments
- Document specific adjustments needed
- Note items to watch in Phase 2
- Proceed with enhanced monitoring

**REVISE:** Significant gaps or inconsistencies → Return to Phase 1 agents
- Provide detailed feedback to agents
- Request specific revisions
- Re-run validation after updates

**ESCALATE:** Fundamental problems or scope questions → Pause for human review
- Document critical issues
- Identify decision points requiring stakeholder input
- Await human guidance before proceeding

## Risk Management

### Current Risks
- **R001-MITIGATED:** Agent invocation requires human coordination
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive invocation guides created
  - Status: Clear step-by-step instructions provided

- **R002-ACCEPTED:** File-based agent handoffs
  - Mitigation: Structured deliverable formats defined
  - Status: Output locations and formats specified

- **R003-MITIGATED:** Context completeness for validation
  - Mitigation: Detailed context documents created
  - Status: All necessary background documented

### Future Risks
Will be assessed at each validation gate and documented in ORCHESTRATION_STATUS.md

---

## Communication Protocol

### Orchestrator Availability
The orchestrator is available for:
1. Validation gate reviews (after each phase)
2. Inter-phase context refinement
3. Escalation handling
4. Decision point resolution
5. Quality assurance reviews

### Escalation Process
If agents encounter:
- **Unclear requirements:** Reference context documents or escalate to orchestrator
- **Contradictory information:** Flag for orchestrator review
- **New decision points:** Document and escalate immediately
- **Scope questions:** Pause and request orchestrator guidance

   - Document findings for each criterion
   - Identify gaps or issues

4. **Decision Making**
   - Synthesize validation findings
   - Apply decision matrix
   - Make explicit go/no-go decision

5. **Context Generation**
   - If approved: Generate next phase context
   - If conditional: Document adjustments
   - If revise: Provide detailed feedback
   - If escalate: Document critical issues

6. **Communication**
   - Deliver validation decision
   - Provide rationale and findings
   - Give clear next steps
   - Update orchestration status
