## 2. Testing Strategy

### 2.1 Unit Testing

**Scope:** Individual components in isolation with mocked dependencies

**Key Areas:**

- **SwarmOrchestrator:** Agent spawning, task distribution, result aggregation
- **LoopExecutor:** Iteration logic, convergence evaluation, checkpointing
- **ConfigManager:** Configuration loading, merging, validation
- **QueueRepository:** SQLite CRUD operations, transaction handling

**Testing Approach:**
- Mock all external dependencies (Claude API, GitHub, filesystem)
- Test edge cases (empty queues, invalid inputs, boundary conditions)
- Verify error handling (exceptions, validation failures)
- Test state transitions (task states, agent lifecycle)

**Tools:**
- pytest (test framework)
- pytest-mock (mocking)
- pytest-cov (coverage reporting)
- hypothesis (property-based testing for complex logic)

**Coverage Target:** >90% for core business logic

### 2.2 Integration Testing

**Scope:** Component interactions with real dependencies (SQLite, filesystem)

**Key Areas:**
- **Template + Queue Integration:** Initialize template → submit task → validate persistence
- **Queue + Swarm Integration:** Submit task → spawn agent → update task state
- **Loop + Queue Integration:** Start loop → iterate → checkpoint → resume
- **Config + All Modules:** Configuration changes propagate correctly
- **Monitoring Integration:** Actions trigger correct log entries and metrics

**Testing Approach:**

**Coverage Target:** >80% of integration paths

### 2.3 End-to-End Testing

**Scope:** Complete user workflows from CLI invocation to task completion

**Key Workflows:**
1. **Initialization Workflow:** `abathur init` → template cloned → validation passes
2. **Basic Task Workflow:** `abathur task submit` → agent executes → `abathur task detail` shows result
3. **Swarm Workflow:** Submit 10 tasks → 10 agents spawn → concurrent execution → all complete
4. **Loop Workflow:** `abathur loop start` → iterate until convergence → checkpoint → resume after crash
5. **Failure Recovery Workflow:** Submit task → kill process → restart → task resumes
6. **Priority Workflow:** Submit tasks with priorities 0-10 → verify execution order

**Testing Approach:**
- Invoke CLI commands programmatically (subprocess or click.testing)
- Use real Claude API (with test account and rate limits)
- Verify CLI output formatting (human-readable, JSON)
- Test error messages and user guidance
- Measure end-to-end latency
