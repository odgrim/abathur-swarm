---

### 4. Cross-Reference Requirements

Ensure all cross-references are resolved:

#### Within-PRD References
- ✅ "See Section 2.3 for constraints" (link to section 2.3)
- ✅ "Refer to FR-QUEUE-001" (link to functional requirement)
- ✅ "Described in Architecture Layer 2" (link to architecture section)

#### External References
- ✅ DECISION_POINTS.md: Link to resolved decisions (e.g., "Python 3.10+ selected per DP-001")
- ✅ GitHub repository: Link to template repo (odgrim/abathur-claude-template)
- ✅ Anthropic docs: Link to Claude SDK documentation

#### Terminology Consistency
- ✅ "Agent" vs "Claude agent" (use consistently)
- ✅ "Task queue" vs "Queue" (use consistently)
- ✅ "Template" vs "Agent template" (define in glossary, use consistently)

---

### 5. Formatting Guidelines

#### Markdown Standards
- Use ATX-style headers (# ## ###)
- Code blocks with language specification (```python)
- Tables with alignment (left-align text, right-align numbers)
- Bullet lists with consistent indentation (2 spaces)

#### Section Numbering
- Top-level sections: 1, 2, 3, ...
- Subsections: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, ...
- Sub-subsections: 1.1.1, 1.1.2, ...

#### Page Layout
- Maximum line length: 120 characters (for readability)
- Section breaks: Use `---` horizontal rules between major sections
- Whitespace: 2 blank lines before major sections, 1 before subsections

#### Visual Hierarchy
- **Bold** for emphasis and section summaries
- *Italic* for terminology definitions
- `Code style` for technical terms, file paths, commands
- > Blockquotes for important notes and warnings

---

### 6. Quality Checklist

---

## Integration Guidelines

### Handling Overlaps

Some content appears in multiple source documents. Consolidation strategy:

#### Example: API Key Management
- **Vision**: Mentions "secure API key storage" as key benefit
- **Requirements**: FR-CONFIG-004 specifies keychain precedence
- **Architecture**: Describes 3-tier fallback (env → keychain → .env)
- **Security**: SR-AUTH-002 details keychain integration

**Integration Approach:**
1. **Primary location**: Section 6.2 (Security Requirements → SR-AUTH-002)
2. **Cross-references**: Link from Requirements (FR-CONFIG-004) and Architecture to Security section
3. **Summary**: Brief mention in Executive Summary ("Secure API key storage via platform keychain")

#### Example: Success Metrics
- **Vision**: Product success metrics (500+ users, 10k+ tasks/month)
- **Quality Metrics**: Technical success metrics (>99.9% persistence, <100ms latency)

**Integration Approach:**
1. **Primary location**: Section 7.1 (Quality Metrics → Success Metrics)
2. **Executive Summary**: Highlight both product and technical metrics
3. **Cross-reference**: Link from Vision to Quality Metrics section

---

### Terminology Standardization

Use the following standard terms consistently:

| Preferred Term | Avoid | Definition |
|----------------|-------|------------|
| **Abathur** | "The system", "The tool" | Product name (always capitalized) |
| **Claude agent** | "Agent", "AI", "LLM" | Anthropic Claude instance with specific role |
| **Task queue** | "Queue", "Job queue" | Persistent SQLite-backed task storage |
| **Template** | "Configuration", "Setup" | Git-based agent configuration repository |
| **Swarm** | "Multi-agent", "Cluster" | Coordinated group of concurrent agents |
| **Loop** | "Iteration", "Refinement loop" | Iterative execution with convergence |
| **MCP server** | "Tool server", "Integration" | Model Context Protocol server for tool access |

## Notes for Documentation Specialist

### Key Success Factors

1. **Integration over Duplication**: When content overlaps, consolidate into primary section and cross-reference
2. **Consistency is Critical**: Use terminology glossary to maintain consistent language
3. **Accessibility**: Write for dual audiences (technical and business stakeholders)
4. **Actionability**: Every requirement must be implementable without ambiguity

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Copy-paste without integration (creates redundancy)
- ❌ Broken cross-references (validate all links)
- ❌ Inconsistent terminology (use glossary)
- ❌ Missing context (every section should stand alone with cross-refs)
- ❌ Incomplete executive summary (must cover all key points)

### Quality Bar

This PRD will be the **authoritative specification** for a 6-month, $0 cost (excluding API), 3-engineer project delivering 88 requirements. It must be:

- **Complete**: No missing information or TBD placeholders
- **Correct**: No technical errors or contradictions
- **Clear**: Understandable by all stakeholders
- **Consistent**: Unified terminology and formatting
- **Professional**: Ready for external publication

---

**Document Status:** Ready for Agent Invocation
**Next Agent:** `[prd-documentation-specialist]`
**Expected Duration:** 1-2 days
**Critical Path:** Yes (final deliverable before dev handoff)
