    - `tasks` table with indexes (status, priority, submitted_at)
    - `agents` table with indexes (task_id, state)
    - `state` table with indexes (task_id, key)
    - `audit` table with indexes (task_id, timestamp)
    - `metrics` table with indexes (metric_name, timestamp)

  - `QueueRepository`: CRUD operations for tasks
  - `StateStore`: Key-value state management with optimistic locking
  - Connection pool management (aiosqlite)
  - Transaction handling with context managers
  - **Tests:** Unit tests for all repository methods, transaction rollback scenarios

#### Week 3: Configuration Management

  - Keychain integration (keyring library) with `.env` fallback
  - Configuration schema definition (`ConfigSchema` model)

- **Template Config Schema**
  - Define `.abathur/config.yaml` structure
  - Validation rules (priority 0-10, timeout >0, etc.)
  - Default values for all settings
  - **Tests:** Config loading, merging, validation, keychain fallback

#### Week 4: CLI Framework Skeleton

## 7. Risk Management

### Critical Risks (High Impact, Require Mitigation)

#### R1: Claude API Changes Break Compatibility
- **Probability:** Medium (API evolves regularly)
- **Impact:** High (core functionality broken)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Pin Anthropic SDK version in `pyproject.toml`
  - Wrap SDK with abstraction layer (ClaudeClient)
  - Monitor Anthropic announcements for breaking changes
  - Maintain compatibility test suite against SDK
- **Contingency:** Rapid adapter release if breaking change occurs

#### R2: Asyncio Concurrency Bugs (Race Conditions, Deadlocks)
- **Probability:** Medium (complex async code)
- **Impact:** High (data corruption, hangs)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Extensive unit tests for concurrent scenarios
  - Static analysis with mypy (strict mode)
  - Code review focus on async patterns (asyncio.Lock, semaphores)
  - Use proven patterns (asyncio.TaskGroup, context managers)
- **Contingency:** Refactor to simpler threading model if asyncio proves unmanageable

#### R3: SQLite Performance Insufficient at Scale
- **Probability:** Low (SQLite well-tested for this workload)
- **Impact:** Medium (queue operations slow, NFR violation)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Early load testing (10k tasks, 10 concurrent agents)
  - Index optimization (EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN analysis)
  - Connection pooling and prepared statements
  - WAL mode for concurrent reads
- **Contingency:** Migration path to Redis documented (Phase 4+)

#### R4: Scope Creep Delays v1.0 Release
- **Probability:** High (common for feature-rich projects)
- **Impact:** Medium (timeline slip)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Strict phase gates (no new features once phase starts)
  - MVP focus in Phase 1 (defer "nice-to-have" to v1.1)
  - Feature freeze at week 20 (only bug fixes after)
  - Weekly progress reviews with tech lead
- **Contingency:** Push non-critical features to v1.1 roadmap

### Medium Risks (Require Monitoring)

#### R5: Cross-Platform Issues (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Probability:** Medium (platform-specific keychain, file paths)
- **Impact:** Medium (blocks users on specific platforms)
- **Mitigation:**
  - CI matrix testing on all platforms
  - Graceful fallbacks (keychain → .env file)
  - Cross-platform path handling (pathlib)
- **Contingency:** Platform-specific workarounds documented

#### R6: Dependency Vulnerabilities
- **Probability:** Low (active ecosystem, regular updates)
- **Impact:** High (security risk)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Automated dependency scanning (Safety, Dependabot)
  - Regular dependency updates (monthly)
  - Pin versions in lockfile (poetry.lock)
  - Security audit in week 24
- **Contingency:** Emergency patch release if critical vulnerability found

### Low Risks (Accept or Minor Mitigation)

#### R7: Beta User Recruitment Insufficient
- **Probability:** Low (active Discord community)
- **Impact:** Low (reduced feedback, but internal testing still valid)
- **Mitigation:** Early recruitment announcement (week 20)
- **Contingency:** Internal dogfooding by team

#### R8: Documentation Gaps
- **Probability:** Medium (often deprioritized)
- **Impact:** Low (support burden increases, but not blocking)
- **Mitigation:** Documentation started early (week 22), technical writer involved
- **Contingency:** Post-release documentation improvements
