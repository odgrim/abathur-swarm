## Orchestration Phases

### Phase 1: Data & Architecture Modeling (Week 1)
- **database-schema-architect**: Database schema with SQLite optimizations
- **python-architecture-specialist**: Clean architecture with SOLID principles

### Phase 2: Implementation Specifications (Weeks 2-3)
- **algorithm-design-specialist**: Scheduling, loop convergence, swarm distribution algorithms
- **api-integration-specialist**: Claude Agent SDK integration, MCP configuration loading
- **cli-implementation-specialist**: Typer CLI commands with validation

### Phase 3: Quality, Configuration & Deployment (Week 3-4)
- **testing-strategy-specialist**: Unit, integration, E2E, performance, security tests
- **config-management-specialist**: Pydantic-based configuration with validation
- **deployment-packaging-specialist**: PyPI, Docker, Homebrew distribution

### Phase 4: Documentation & Compilation (Week 4)
- **documentation-specialist**: Implementation guide with examples
- **Final Compilation**: Traceability matrix and validation report

## Source PRD Documents

All specifications are derived from:
- `/prd_deliverables/01_PRODUCT_VISION.md`
- `/prd_deliverables/02_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `/prd_deliverables/03_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `/prd_deliverables/04_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`
- `/prd_deliverables/05_API_CLI_SPECIFICATION.md`
- `/prd_deliverables/06_SECURITY.md`
- `/prd_deliverables/07_QUALITY_METRICS.md`
- `/prd_deliverables/08_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`

## Usage

These technical specifications are implementation-ready and provide:
1. **Complete data models** with SQL schemas and relationships
2. **Architecture blueprints** with module structure and interfaces
3. **Algorithm specifications** with pseudocode and complexity analysis
4. **Integration patterns** with retry logic and error handling
5. **Testing strategies** with coverage targets and test types
6. **Deployment instructions** for PyPI, Docker, and package managers

## Quality Criteria

All specifications meet:
- **Completeness**: 100% PRD requirement coverage
- **Clarity**: No ambiguity in implementation details
- **Actionability**: Developers can implement directly from specs
- **Traceability**: All requirements mapped to technical designs
- **Validation**: Each specification validated against PRD constraints
