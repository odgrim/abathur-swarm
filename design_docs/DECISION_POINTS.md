- [ ] Cloud-based queue (AWS SQS, GCP Pub/Sub - managed but vendor lock-in)
- [ ] Other: __________

**Suggestion**: Start with SQLite for persistence with option to upgrade to Redis for distributed scenarios. Provides good balance of simplicity and capability.

### 2. Agent Communication Protocol
How should agents communicate and coordinate?
- [ ] Direct API calls between agents
- [ x ] Message queue-based communication (asynchronous)
- [ x ] Shared state database
- [ ] Event-driven architecture with pub/sub
- [ ] Hybrid approach (specify): __________

**Suggestion**: Message queue + shared state database for robust async coordination with persistent tracking.

### 3. State Management Strategy
How should system state be managed?

- [ ] Distributed state with eventual consistency
- [ ] Event sourcing pattern
- [ ] CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- [ ] Other: __________

**Suggestion**: Centralized state store with SQLite for simplicity, event log for auditability.

### 4. CLI Framework
Which Python CLI framework should be used?

**Suggestion**: Latest stable Anthropic Python SDK with version pinning in requirements.

### 9. Template Repository Strategy
Q: Should the template repository be:
- [ x ] Statically versioned (tags/releases)
- [ ] Always use latest main branch
- [ x ] Allow user to specify version/tag
- [ ] Cached locally with update mechanism

**Suggestion**: Versioned releases with user choice to pin or use latest, local caching with update checks.
**Clarification**: There's a chance we make changes to the cli that necessitate changes to the template. CLI versions should specify a default version of the template that matches

### 10. Dependency Management
Q: How should dependencies be managed?
- [ ] requirements.txt
- [ x ] Poetry (pyproject.toml + poetry.lock)
- [ ] Pipenv (Pipfile + Pipfile.lock)

## Notes for Implementation Teams

- All architectural decisions should be finalized before Phase 2 implementation begins
- Decision rationale should be documented for future reference
- Any new decision points discovered during implementation should be escalated to project orchestrator
- Security and compliance decisions should be reviewed by security specialist before implementation

## Notes on Swarm design
When applicable the swarm should attempt to follow a process:
 - Create a specification
 - Gather product/project requirements
 - Write a technical specification if it's a technical problem
 - Write full test suites for validating the specification if it's a technical problem
 - Implement solutions while constantly validating progress against the tests

A core pillar of our swarm is the ability to spawn more hyperspecialized agents to perform work.

We should be able to improve agents- just like abathur improves the swarm we need a dedicated abathur agent that has the ability to improve agents based on feedback.
