## Project Kickoff: Abathur Technical Specifications

I'm ready to develop comprehensive technical specifications for Abathur from the completed PRD using a coordinated agent team approach.

**Project Overview:**
- **Project:** Abathur - CLI tool for managing agent swarms with Claude Code
- **Objective:** Transform PRD documents in `/prd_deliverables/` into implementation-ready technical specifications
- **PRD Status:** Complete (8 documents covering vision, requirements, architecture, API/CLI, security, quality, roadmap)
- **Technical Specs Goal:** Detailed specifications covering database, architecture, algorithms, integrations, CLI, testing, configuration, deployment

**Agent Team & Execution Sequence:**

### Phase 1: Data & Architecture Modeling (Week 1)

1. `[database-schema-architect]` - Design complete database schema with DDL, indexes, and constraints (Sonnet)
2. `[python-architecture-specialist]` - Design clean Python architecture with SOLID principles and asyncio patterns (Sonnet)
3. `[tech-specs-orchestrator]` - **PHASE 1 VALIDATION GATE** - Review data and architecture deliverables (Sonnet)

### Phase 2: Implementation Specifications (Weeks 2-3)

4. `[algorithm-design-specialist]` - Design task scheduling, loop convergence, and swarm distribution algorithms with complexity analysis (Thinking)
5. `[api-integration-specialist]` - Design Claude SDK, GitHub API, and MCP integrations with retry logic and error handling (Thinking)
6. `[cli-implementation-specialist]` - Design Typer CLI commands with validation and output formatting (Thinking)
7. `[tech-specs-orchestrator]` - **PHASE 2 VALIDATION GATE** - Review implementation specifications (Sonnet)

### Phase 3: Quality, Configuration & Deployment (Week 3-4)

8. `[testing-strategy-specialist]` - Design comprehensive testing strategy with unit, integration, E2E, performance, and security tests (Sonnet)
9. `[config-management-specialist]` - Design Pydantic-based configuration system with validation and secret management (Sonnet)
10. `[deployment-packaging-specialist]` - Design PyPI, Docker, and Homebrew distribution strategies (Sonnet)
11. `[tech-specs-orchestrator]` - **PHASE 3 VALIDATION GATE** - Review quality and deployment specifications (Sonnet)

### Phase 4: Documentation & Compilation (Week 4)

12. `[documentation-specialist]` - Create comprehensive technical documentation with implementation guide and examples (Haiku)
13. `[tech-specs-orchestrator]` - **FINAL COMPILATION** - Compile all specs, generate traceability matrix, validate completeness (Sonnet)

**Context Passing Instructions:**

After each agent completes their work, the orchestrator will:
- Review deliverable completeness and quality
- Validate alignment with PRD requirements
- Check consistency with other specifications
- Provide refined context to next agent
- Make go/no-go decisions at validation gates

**Critical Phase Validation Requirements:**

At each validation gate, the orchestrator must:
- Thoroughly review all phase deliverables
- Validate alignment with PRD requirements in `/prd_deliverables/`
- Assess specification clarity and implementation-readiness
- Check consistency across agent outputs
- Make explicit go/no-go decision before next phase
- Update agent context based on findings

**Initial Request:**

Please begin with the `[tech-specs-orchestrator]` to start Phase 1. The orchestrator should:
- Read all PRD documents in `/prd_deliverables/` directory
- Analyze requirements and create coverage map
- Invoke `[database-schema-architect]` with relevant PRD context
- Track deliverables using TodoWrite tool

**CRITICAL FOR GENERAL PURPOSE AGENT:**

**DO NOT perform technical specification work directly!**

Your ONLY job is to invoke the correct project-specific agent:
- Start with `[tech-specs-orchestrator]` for Phase 1 initiation
- Hand off to orchestrator for all validation gates
- Never skip agent handoffs or attempt specification work outside your role
- Always use exact agent names with `[bracket-format]` syntax

**Expected Outputs:**

All technical specifications will be created in `/tech_specs/` directory:
- `database_schema.sql` - Complete DDL with indexes and constraints
- `database_design_doc.md` - ER diagrams and design rationale
- `python_architecture.md` - Module structure and clean architecture layers
- `class_diagrams.md` - Interface definitions and protocols
- `algorithms.md` - Algorithm specifications with pseudocode and complexity analysis
- `api_integrations.md` - Integration patterns with error handling
- `cli_implementation.md` - Command specifications with Typer
- `testing_strategy.md` - Comprehensive test design
- `configuration_management.md` - Pydantic schemas and validation
- `deployment_packaging.md` - PyPI, Docker, Homebrew specifications
- `README.md` - Technical specifications overview
- `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Developer handbook
- `traceability_matrix.md` - PRD requirements to technical specs mapping

**Success Criteria:**

- All PRD requirements have corresponding technical specifications
- Specifications are implementation-ready (no ambiguity)
- Validation gates pass with quality checks
- Traceability matrix shows 100% PRD coverage
- Documentation complete with examples

**Ready to begin the coordinated technical specifications development!**

Begin with Phase 1: Data & Architecture Modeling by invoking the orchestrator.
