## Risk Management

### Critical Risks

**R1: Specification Ambiguity**
- **Impact:** Developers unable to implement without clarification
- **Mitigation:** Validation gates check for clarity, examples for complex concepts
- **Indicator:** Multiple clarification requests during implementation

**R2: PRD-to-Spec Gaps**
- **Impact:** Missing requirements not discovered until implementation
- **Mitigation:** Traceability matrix, coverage analysis by orchestrator
- **Indicator:** PRD requirements without corresponding specs

**R3: Inconsistency Across Specifications**
- **Impact:** Integration failures, architectural misalignment
- **Mitigation:** Phase validation gates check cross-spec consistency
- **Indicator:** Interface mismatches between component specs

**R4: Performance Target Infeasibility**
- **Impact:** NFRs cannot be met with designed algorithms
- **Mitigation:** Complexity analysis validates performance targets
- **Indicator:** Algorithm complexity incompatible with latency targets

### Escalation Procedures

1. **Specification Blocker:** Agent cannot complete task due to missing PRD information
   - **Action:** Orchestrator reviews PRD, makes reasonable assumption documented as "DECISION", escalates to human if critical

2. **Validation Gate Failure:** Specifications do not meet quality criteria
   - **Action:** Orchestrator provides specific feedback, agents revise, re-validate

3. **Consistency Conflict:** Specifications from different agents contradict
   - **Action:** Orchestrator mediates, invokes agents to align, documents resolution

4. **Performance Feasibility Concern:** Specified approach unlikely to meet NFRs
   - **Action:** Escalate to human for architectural decision, document trade-offs
