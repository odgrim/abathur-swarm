## Formatting Requirements

### Markdown Standards

- Use `#` for title, `##` for major sections (1-9), `###` for subsections
- Use tables for structured data (requirements, tasks, risks, metrics)
- Use code blocks with language specifiers for code examples (```python, ```yaml, ```json, etc.)
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps (1., 2., 3., etc.)
- Use bullet lists for non-sequential items (-, *, •)
- Use **bold** for emphasis, *italics* for technical terms
- Use horizontal rules (`---`) to separate major sections

### Professional Formatting

- Consistent header capitalization (Title Case for major sections, Sentence case for subsections)
- Consistent terminology (see "Terminology Standardization" in 00_phase4_context.md)
- Accurate cross-references (e.g., "See Section 4.2 (AuthProvider Abstraction) for details")
- Table of contents (auto-generated or manually created)
- Page breaks before major sections (if converting to PDF)

### Diagrams

- Architecture diagrams: Convert ASCII diagrams to Mermaid if possible, otherwise preserve ASCII formatting
- Example Mermaid conversion:
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
    A[User] --> B[CLI]
    B --> C[ClaudeClient]
    C --> D[AuthProvider]
    D --> E[API Key]
    D --> F[OAuth]
  ```
- If Mermaid conversion is not feasible, preserve original ASCII diagrams with proper formatting
