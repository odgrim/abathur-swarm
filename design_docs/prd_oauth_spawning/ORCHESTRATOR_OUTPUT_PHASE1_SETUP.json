Prerequisites have been validated (DECISION_POINTS.md is comprehensive with 14 decisions resolved). A detailed Phase 1 context document has been created to provide both research agents with complete project understanding. Comprehensive task specifications have been prepared for oauth-research-specialist (OAuth method research) and code-analysis-specialist (Abathur codebase analysis). A 28-task TODO list has been initialized to track progress across all 4 phases. The project is now READY FOR AGENT INVOCATION. Human action required: Invoke oauth-research-specialist and code-analysis-specialist in parallel using the invocation commands in HUMAN_ACTION_REQUIRED.md. After both agents complete their deliverables (01_oauth_research.md and 02_current_architecture.md), invoke the orchestrator again for Phase 1 validation gate processing.",
