### Success Criteria
1. Support all 10 core requirements comprehensively
2. Maintain backward compatibility with existing code
3. Achieve performance targets (<50ms reads, <500ms semantic search)
4. Provide complete migration and rollback procedures
5. Enable concurrent access for 50+ agents
6. Include comprehensive test coverage and documentation

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Database Schema

**Location:** `/Users/odgrim/dev/home/agentics/abathur/src/abathur/infrastructure/database.py`

**Current Tables:**
1. **tasks** - Task queue management
   - Columns: id, prompt, agent_type, priority, status, input_data, result_data, error_message, retry_count, max_retries, max_execution_timeout_seconds, timestamps
   - Indexes: status_priority, submitted_at, parent_task, running_timeout
   - Features: Task dependencies, parent-child relationships, timeout tracking

2. **agents** - Agent lifecycle tracking
   - Columns: id, name, specialization, task_id, state, model, spawned_at, terminated_at, resource_usage
   - Indexes: task_id, state
   - Features: Agent state management, resource tracking

3. **state** - Task-scoped state storage
   - Columns: id, task_id, key, value, created_at, updated_at
   - Indexes: task_key
   - Features: Key-value state storage per task
   - **Gap:** No namespace scoping, no memory type differentiation

4. **audit** - Action audit trail
   - Columns: id, timestamp, agent_id, task_id, action_type, action_data, result
   - Indexes: task_timestamp, agent_timestamp, timestamp
   - Features: Comprehensive event logging

5. **metrics** - System metrics
   - Columns: id, timestamp, metric_name, metric_value, labels

   - No hierarchical namespace organization (user:, app:, session:, temp:)

2. **Limited Session Management**
   - No session lifecycle tracking
   - No event history per session
   - No session-scoped state isolation

3. **No Semantic Search**
   - No vector embedding storage
   - No similarity search capabilities
   - No memory consolidation or conflict resolution

4. **Missing Project Scoping**
   - No multi-project isolation
   - No project-level memory sharing

5. **Limited Learning Capabilities**
   - No pattern capture and storage
   - No success/failure analysis persistence
   - No strategy optimization data

## Stateless Agent Architecture

**Design Pattern:** Pure functions with discrete deliverables

**Principles:**
1. **Context Passing:** Orchestrator provides complete context for each agent invocation
2. **Structured Output:** Agents produce standardized JSON output for orchestrator parsing
3. **No Inter-Agent Communication:** Orchestrator handles all coordination
4. **Complete Deliverables:** Each agent output is self-contained
5. **Validation Gates:** Orchestrator validates before phase progression

**Agent Output Schema:**
```json
{
  "execution_status": {
    "status": "SUCCESS|FAILURE|PARTIAL",
    "completion": "percentage|phase-name",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601-timestamp",
    "agent_name": "[agent-name]"
  },
  "deliverables": {
    "files_created": ["absolute/paths"],
    "files_modified": ["absolute/paths"],
    "analysis_results": ["findings"],
    "artifacts": ["urls", "references"]
  },
  "orchestration_context": {
    "next_recommended_action": "description",
    "dependencies_resolved": ["list"],
    "dependencies_discovered": ["list"],
    "blockers_encountered": ["descriptions"],
    "context_for_next_agent": {
      "relevant_outputs": "summary",
      "state_changes": "modifications",
      "warnings": "issues"
    }
  },
  "quality_metrics": {
    "success_criteria_met": ["criteria"],
    "success_criteria_failed": ["criteria"],
    "validation_results": "pass|fail|partial",
    "performance_notes": "observations"
  },
  "human_readable_summary": "brief summary"
}
```

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Mandatory Validation Checkpoints

**Phase 1 Validation Gate:**
- Deliverable completeness (all documents created)
- Memory architecture coverage (all types addressed)
- Schema design coherence (relationships valid)
- Migration feasibility (data preservation plan exists)
- Requirements alignment (all 10 requirements covered)

**Phase 2 Validation Gate:**
- DDL syntax validation (all statements valid)
- Query optimization verification (EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN)
- API completeness (all CRUD operations)
- Test coverage adequacy (unit + integration + performance)
- Implementation readiness (clear step-by-step guide)

**Phase 3 Validation Gate:**
- Roadmap completeness (all milestones defined)
- Testing strategy comprehensiveness (all test types)
- Migration procedure detail (executable scripts)
- Rollback procedure completeness (recovery guaranteed)
- Risk mitigation adequacy (all risks addressed)

### Escalation Procedures

**Trigger Conditions:**
1. Agent failure after 3 attempts → Retry with enhanced context
2. Persistent failure → Invoke specialist debugging
3. Systemic issues → Escalate to human oversight
4. Scope changes → Update orchestrator configuration
5. Unresolved decision points → Halt and request human decision

---

## Performance Monitoring

**Metrics to Track:**
1. Agent success/failure rates per phase
2. Average time per agent invocation
3. Context passing effectiveness
4. Validation gate passage rates
5. Human intervention requirements
6. Deliverable completeness scores

**Expected Performance:**
- Phase 1: 30-45 minutes
- Phase 2: 20-30 minutes
- Phase 3: 15-20 minutes
- Total: 65-95 minutes
