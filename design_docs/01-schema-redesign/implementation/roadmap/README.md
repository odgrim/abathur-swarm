## Quick Reference

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Validation Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Exact-match reads | <50ms (99th percentile) | EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN + benchmarks |
| Semantic search | <500ms (with embeddings) | End-to-end latency tests |
| Concurrent sessions | 50+ agents | Load testing with asyncio |
| Database size capacity | 10GB target | Archival strategy in place |

### Key Dependencies

**Phase 1 & 2 Deliverables:**
- [Phase 1 Design Documents](../phase1_design/)
- [Phase 2 Technical Specifications](../phase2_tech_specs/)

**External Dependencies:**
- Python 3.11+
- SQLite 3.35+
- aiosqlite (existing)
- sqlite-vss extension (Milestone 3)
- Ollama + nomic-embed-text-v1.5 (Milestone 3)

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Phased Approach:** Each milestone must pass go/no-go validation before proceeding
2. **Testing Rigor:** Comprehensive testing at every milestone (unit → integration → performance)
3. **Rollback Readiness:** Complete rollback procedures tested at each milestone
4. **Performance Validation:** All queries must show proper index usage via EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
5. **Documentation:** All procedures documented and validated before production deployment

## Risk Management Summary

### High-Priority Risks

1. **Performance Degradation** (Medium Probability, High Impact)
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive index strategy, EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN validation
   - Contingency: Performance optimization sprint if targets missed

2. **Concurrent Access Issues** (Low Probability, High Impact)
   - Mitigation: WAL mode configuration, busy_timeout settings, load testing
   - Contingency: Connection pooling adjustments, query optimization

3. **Data Integrity Violations** (Low Probability, Critical Impact)
   - Mitigation: Foreign key enforcement, JSON validation constraints, comprehensive testing
   - Contingency: Immediate rollback, restore from backup

4. **Vector Search Latency** (Medium Probability, Medium Impact)
   - Mitigation: Embedding dimension optimization (768), index tuning
   - Contingency: Defer semantic search to Phase 2, focus on exact-match queries

### Risk Response Plan

- **Go/No-Go Decision Points:** Each milestone has clear acceptance criteria
- **Rollback Triggers:** Performance degradation >20%, critical bugs, data integrity issues
- **Escalation Path:** Development team → Tech lead → Project stakeholder
