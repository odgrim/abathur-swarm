## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Production Data Migration Issues

**Description:** Fresh start approach may miss critical data from existing system
- **Probability:** Low (fresh start project, no migration)
- **Impact:** Low
- **Mitigation:**
  - Confirm no existing production data to migrate
  - Validate fresh start approach with stakeholders
  - Document data seeding procedures
- **Contingency:** N/A (fresh start confirmed)

### Risk 2: Performance Degradation Under Load

**Description:** Production load may exceed development/staging testing
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:**
  - Conduct load testing with 2x expected production load
  - Monitor first 48 hours continuously
  - Have performance optimization sprint ready
- **Contingency:** Scale down concurrent users, optimize slow queries

### Risk 3: Monitoring Blind Spots

**Description:** Critical metrics may not be captured in dashboards
- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Review all monitoring dashboards with operations team
  - Test all alerting rules before production deployment
  - Add custom metrics for memory-specific operations
- **Contingency:** Add missing metrics during 48-hour validation period

### Risk 4: Operational Complexity

**Description:** Team may not be ready for production support
- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:**
  - Comprehensive training on operational runbooks
  - Establish on-call rotation with experienced engineers
  - Create quick reference guides for common issues
- **Contingency:** Extend monitoring period to 1 week, daily team sync
