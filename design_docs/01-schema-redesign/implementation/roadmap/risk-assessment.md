# Risk Assessment - Comprehensive Risk Analysis and Mitigation

## Overview

This document provides complete risk analysis for the SQLite Schema Redesign implementation, categorizing risks by type (technical, performance, operational), assessing probability and impact, and defining mitigation strategies.

**Risk Management Approach:** Proactive identification, continuous monitoring, rapid mitigation

**Risk Tolerance:** Low for data integrity, medium for performance, high for feature completeness

## 1. Risk Assessment Matrix

### 1.1 Risk Scoring

**Probability:**
- **High (H):** >50% chance of occurrence
- **Medium (M):** 20-50% chance of occurrence
- **Low (L):** <20% chance of occurrence

**Impact:**
- **Critical (C):** Data loss, system unavailability, major security breach
- **High (H):** Significant performance degradation, user impact, schedule delay >2 weeks
- **Medium (M):** Moderate performance issues, limited user impact, schedule delay 1-2 weeks
- **Low (L):** Minor issues, no user impact, schedule delay <1 week

**Risk Level Calculation:**
- **Critical Risk:** Probability × Impact = High-Critical or Medium-Critical
- **High Risk:** Probability × Impact = High-High or Medium-High
- **Medium Risk:** Probability × Impact = Medium-Medium or Low-High
- **Low Risk:** All other combinations

## 2. Technical Risks

### Risk T1: Foreign Key Performance Impact

**Category:** Technical - Database Performance
**Probability:** Medium (30%)
**Impact:** Medium (performance degradation 10-20%)
