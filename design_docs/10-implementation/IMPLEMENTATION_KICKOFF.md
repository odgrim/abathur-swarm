# Abathur Implementation Kickoff Guide

**Project:** Abathur - Hivemind Swarm Management System
**Timeline:** 25 weeks (Phases 0-3)
**Status:** Design Complete → Ready for Phase 0 Implementation
**Created:** 2025-10-09

---

## Quick Start

You now have a complete implementation strategy with **specialized Claude sub-agents** ready to execute the 25-week development plan. All PRD requirements (88 functional + 30 non-functional) and technical specifications are finalized.

---

## Created Agents (3 of 15)

The meta-orchestrator has created **3 core management agents** in `.claude/agents/`:

### 1. project-orchestrator (Sonnet)
**Role:** Central coordination, phase validation gates, go/no-go decisions

**Critical Function:** Validates deliverables at end of each phase before proceeding
- Phase 0 validation gate (Week 4)
- Phase 1 validation gate (Week 10)
- Phase 2 validation gate (Week 18)
- Final validation gate (Week 25)

**Decision Authority:** APPROVE / CONDITIONAL / REVISE / ESCALATE

**Invoke with:** `@project-orchestrator`

### 2. technical-architect (Sonnet)
**Role:** Architecture oversight, Clean Architecture enforcement, SOLID principles validation

**Focus:** Ensures codebase adheres to 4-layer architecture (CLI → Application → Domain → Infrastructure)

**Invoke with:** `@technical-architect`

### 3. quality-assurance-lead (Sonnet)
**Role:** Testing strategy, coverage validation (>80% overall, >90% critical paths), performance benchmarking

**Quality Gates:** All NFR targets, security audit (0 critical/high vulnerabilities)

**Invoke with:** `@quality-assurance-lead`

---

## Remaining Agents to Create

The meta-orchestrator designed 12 additional agents (not yet created):

### Implementation Agents (7 - Thinking/Opus class)
4. **foundation-setup-specialist** - Phase 0: Repository, CI/CD, database schema, config
5. **template-management-engineer** - Phase 1: Git cloning, caching, validation
6. **task-queue-developer** - Phase 1: TaskCoordinator, priority scheduling, persistence
7. **async-concurrency-specialist** - Phase 2: Agent pool, semaphore control, swarm orchestration
8. **loop-execution-engineer** - Phase 3: LoopExecutor, convergence, checkpoint/resume
9. **mcp-integration-specialist** - Phase 3: MCP server loading, agent-to-server binding
10. **cli-framework-developer** - Cross-phase: Typer commands, 20+ CLI commands

### Support Agents (4)
11. **python-debugging-specialist** (Thinking/Opus) - Asyncio, pytest, SQLite debugging
12. **code-review-specialist** (Sonnet) - Code quality, SOLID, asyncio patterns
13. **security-auditor** (Sonnet) - API key security, vulnerability scanning (Week 24)
14. **documentation-specialist** (Haiku) - User guide, API reference, troubleshooting

### Deployment Agent (1)
15. **deployment-packaging-specialist** (Thinking/Opus) - PyPI, Docker, Homebrew

---

## How to Begin Phase 0 (Weeks 1-4)

### Option 1: Create All Agents First (Recommended)

Request the meta-orchestrator to create remaining agents:

```
Please create the remaining 12 specialized agents for Abathur implementation:
- foundation-setup-specialist (Thinking)
- template-management-engineer (Thinking)
- task-queue-developer (Thinking)
- async-concurrency-specialist (Thinking)
- loop-execution-engineer (Thinking)
- mcp-integration-specialist (Thinking)
- cli-framework-developer (Thinking)
- python-debugging-specialist (Thinking)
- code-review-specialist (Sonnet)
- security-auditor (Sonnet)
- documentation-specialist (Haiku)
- deployment-packaging-specialist (Thinking)

Use the same systematic approach as the first 3 agents, following the agent creation template and tool allocation strategy from the meta-orchestrator report.
```

### Option 2: Start Phase 0 Immediately

If you want to begin implementation now with the 3 created agents:

```
@project-orchestrator - Begin Phase 0 (Foundation) implementation for Abathur.

Current Phase: Phase 0 (Weeks 1-4)
Goal: Establish development infrastructure, database schema, configuration system, CLI skeleton

Phase 0 Deliverables:
- Week 1: Repository setup, CI/CD pipeline, directory structure
- Week 2: SQLite schema with WAL mode, QueueRepository, StateStore
- Week 3: ConfigManager with YAML + env var hierarchy, keychain integration
- Week 4: Typer CLI skeleton, structlog configuration

Success Criteria:
- All developers can clone and run tests locally
- CI pipeline passes (tests, linting, type checking on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- SQLite schema queryable with indexes
- Configuration loads from files and environment
- CLI responds to --help and --version
- Unit test coverage >70%

Please coordinate the implementation, invoking appropriate agents as needed. Since the specialized implementation agents aren't created yet, you may need to handle foundation work directly or guide me to create the foundation-setup-specialist agent first.
```

## Phase-by-Phase Execution Plan

### Phase 0: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal:** Dev environment, DB schema, config system, CLI skeleton

**Key Agents:**
- foundation-setup-specialist (implementation)
- technical-architect (architecture review)
- quality-assurance-lead (test strategy)
- project-orchestrator (validation gate)

**Validation Gate:** Week 4 - All tests pass, CI green, dev environment working

### Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 5-10)
**Goal:** Template management, task queue, basic agent execution

**Key Agents:**
- template-management-engineer
- task-queue-developer
- cli-framework-developer
- async-concurrency-specialist (basic execution)

**Validation Gate:** Week 10 - End-to-end workflow completes in <5 minutes

### Phase 2: Swarm Coordination (Weeks 11-18)
**Goal:** Concurrent agents, swarm orchestration, failure recovery

**Key Agents:**
- async-concurrency-specialist (primary)
- python-debugging-specialist (escalation support)

**Validation Gate:** Week 18 - 10 concurrent agents with <10% degradation

### Phase 3: Production (Weeks 19-25)
**Goal:** Loop execution, MCP integration, docs, deployment, v1.0

**Key Agents:**
- loop-execution-engineer
- mcp-integration-specialist
- cli-framework-developer (advanced features)
- documentation-specialist
- deployment-packaging-specialist
- security-auditor (Week 24 audit)

**Validation Gate:** Week 25 - All use cases working, beta feedback positive, v1.0 launch

---

## Critical Success Factors

### Quality Gates (Must Pass)
- **Phase 0:** >70% coverage, CI green
- **Phase 1:** <5min to first task (NFR-USE-001)
- **Phase 2:** 10 agents <10% degradation (NFR-PERF-004)
- **Phase 3:** >80% overall coverage, >90% critical paths, 0 critical/high vulnerabilities

### Phase Validation Protocol
Each phase MUST be validated by `project-orchestrator` before proceeding:
- APPROVE: Proceed to next phase
- CONDITIONAL: Proceed with monitoring
- REVISE: Address gaps before proceeding
- ESCALATE: Human oversight required

### Error Escalation
Implementation agents can invoke debugging specialists when blocked:
- Use `@python-debugging-specialist` for asyncio, pytest, SQLite issues
- Use TodoWrite to mark tasks as BLOCKED
- Preserve full context for debugging handoff

   - Request meta-orchestrator to create the 12 remaining agents
   - OR proceed with the 3 created agents and create others as needed

2. **Begin Phase 0 Implementation**
   - Invoke `@project-orchestrator` to start coordinated implementation
   - OR directly invoke `@foundation-setup-specialist` (once created)

3. **Follow Phase Validation Protocol**
   - Complete Phase 0 deliverables
   - Invoke `@project-orchestrator` for Phase 0 validation gate
   - Proceed to Phase 1 only after APPROVE decision

4. **Monitor Progress**
   - Use `@project-orchestrator` for status checks
   - Use `@quality-assurance-lead` for coverage analysis
   - Use `@technical-architect` for architecture reviews

## Support

**Meta-Orchestrator:** Can provide additional guidance, create more agents, refine strategy

**Project-Orchestrator:** Central coordination point for all phases

**Human Oversight:** Required for ESCALATE decisions and major timeline adjustments
