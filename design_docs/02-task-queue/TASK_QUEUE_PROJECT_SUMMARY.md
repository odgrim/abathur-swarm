## How It Works

### The Architecture

**Problem Solved:** Your current task queue is too simplistic - agents can't submit subtasks, dependencies aren't enforced, and there's no intelligent prioritization.

**Solution:** Three-tier architecture with:

1. **Dependency Management**
   - New `task_dependencies` table stores prerequisites
   - DFS algorithm detects circular dependencies BEFORE insert
   - Tasks automatically transition: PENDING → BLOCKED → READY → RUNNING → COMPLETED
   - When task completes, dependent tasks automatically unblocked

2. **Priority Scheduling**
   - Multi-factor scoring: base priority + urgency + dependency boost + starvation prevention + source boost
   - Dynamic recalculation (every 5 minutes by default)
   - Priority queue ensures critical tasks execute first

3. **Hierarchical Task Submission**
   - `parent_task_id` creates task hierarchy
   - `source` field tracks origin (HUMAN, AGENT_REQUIREMENTS, AGENT_PLANNER, AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION)
   - Agents call `submit_subtask()` API to break down work

### The Implementation Flow

**Phase 1: Schema & Domain Models (2 days)**
- Database schema architect designs and implements schema updates
- Adds 5 new columns to tasks table
- Creates task_dependencies table with foreign keys
- Updates domain models (enums, Task, TaskDependency)
- Creates performance indexes
- Writes unit tests

**Phase 2: Dependency Resolution (3 days)**
- Algorithm specialist implements DependencyResolver service
- DFS-based circular dependency detection
- Dependency graph building from database
- Performance target: <10ms for 100-task graph

**Phase 3: Priority Calculation (2 days)**
- Backend developer implements PriorityCalculator service
- Multi-factor scoring formula
- Urgency calculation (deadline proximity)
- Dependency boost (how many tasks blocked)
- Starvation prevention (wait time boost)
- Source boost (HUMAN > AGENT_*)

**Phase 4: Task Queue Service (3 days)**
- Backend developer refactors TaskQueueService
- submit_task: Check circular deps → Assign status → Calculate priority → Insert
- dequeue_next_task: Query READY tasks by calculated_priority DESC
- complete_task: Update status → Resolve dependencies → Unblock dependents
- recalculate_all_priorities: Periodic priority updates

**Phase 5: Integration & Testing (2 days)**
- Test engineer writes comprehensive test suite
- Performance specialist validates all targets
- Documentation writer creates API docs and user guide
- Orchestrator performs final validation

### The Validation Gates

After each phase, orchestrator:
1. Reviews all deliverables
2. Validates against acceptance criteria
3. Runs tests and performance benchmarks
4. Makes go/no-go decision: APPROVE / CONDITIONAL / REVISE / ESCALATE
5. Generates refined context for next phase

This ensures quality at every step and prevents accumulation of technical debt.

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Resolve Decision Points (30-60 minutes)

Open `TASK_QUEUE_DECISION_POINTS.md` and fill in the "Decision:" field for each of the 14 decision points.

**Quick Start Option:** Accept all recommended defaults for fastest implementation (10-12 days)

**Key Decisions:**
- Migration strategy (recommend: automatic with backup)
- Dependency limits (recommend: MAX_DEPENDENCIES_PER_TASK=20, MAX_DEPENDENCY_DEPTH=10)
- Priority recalculation frequency (recommend: every 5 minutes)
- Priority weights (recommend: defaults - 1.0, 2.0, 1.5, 0.5, 1.0)
- Circular dependency handling (recommend: reject with error message)
- Task status transitions (recommend: use proposed states)
- Agent subtask submission (recommend: all agents can submit, with rate limits)
- Dependency type semantics (recommend: PARALLEL = AND logic)
- Backward compatibility (recommend: full compatibility)

### Step 2: Review Architecture (Optional, 1-2 hours)

Read `TASK_QUEUE_ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand:
- Domain models (what fields are being added)
- Database schema (what tables/indexes are being created)
- Service layer (how dependency resolution and priority calculation work)
- Performance targets (what benchmarks will be used)

### Step 3: Launch Implementation (5 minutes)

Once decisions are resolved:

1. Open Claude Code in your Abathur project
2. Copy the contents of `TASK_QUEUE_KICKOFF_PROMPT.md`
3. Paste into Claude Code
4. The general agent will invoke `[task-queue-orchestrator]`
5. Orchestrator will begin Phase 1 by invoking `[database-schema-architect]`
6. Monitor progress as agents coordinate through phases

**The orchestrator will:**
- Coordinate all specialist agents
- Track progress with TODO lists
- Validate deliverables at phase gates
- Make go/no-go decisions for each phase
- Handle error escalation to debugging specialists
- Report structured progress updates

---

## Key Features of This Design

### 1. Stateless Agent Architecture
- Each agent is a pure function with discrete deliverables
- Orchestrator handles all coordination (no nested orchestrators)
- Context passed explicitly at invocation
- No inter-agent communication (all through orchestrator)

### 2. Phase Validation Gates
- MANDATORY validation after each major phase
- Go/no-go decisions prevent cascading issues
- Plan refinement based on actual vs expected outcomes
- Context generation ensures next phase has everything needed

### 3. Dynamic Debugging Handoffs
- Implementation agents have authority to invoke debugging specialists
- Use TodoWrite to mark tasks as blocked
- Preserve full context for debugging handoff
- Resume implementation after resolution

### 4. Performance-First Design
- All operations have explicit performance targets
- Indexes designed for query patterns
- Benchmarks validate targets at each phase
- Query plan analysis prevents full table scans

### 5. Backward Compatibility
- Existing task submission API still works
- New fields have sensible defaults
- Gradual migration path
- Feature flags for new behavior (if needed)

## Performance Targets

Your enhanced task queue will meet these aggressive targets:

| Operation | Target | How Validated |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Task submission | 1000+ tasks/sec | Benchmark: insert 10k tasks |
| Dependency resolution | <10ms for 100 tasks | Benchmark: cycle detection on 100-node graph |
| Priority calculation | <5ms per task | Benchmark: 1000 priority calculations |
| Dequeue next task | <5ms | Query plan analysis + benchmark |
| Complete task + unblock | <20ms | Transaction timing measurement |

## Example Workflows

### Hierarchical Task Breakdown

```
Human submits: "Implement user authentication system"
  (TaskSource.HUMAN, priority=8, status=READY)
  ↓

Requirements-gatherer agent creates:
  Task: "Define authentication requirements"
    (TaskSource.AGENT_REQUIREMENTS, depends on human task, status=BLOCKED)
  Task: "Design auth database schema"
    (TaskSource.AGENT_REQUIREMENTS, depends on requirements, status=BLOCKED)
  ↓

When human task completes → requirements task unblocked (status=READY)

Task-planner agent creates:
  Task: "Implement JWT token generation"
    (TaskSource.AGENT_PLANNER, depends on schema, status=BLOCKED)
  Task: "Implement password hashing"
    (TaskSource.AGENT_PLANNER, depends on schema, status=BLOCKED)
  Task: "Implement login endpoint"
    (TaskSource.AGENT_PLANNER, depends on JWT + password, status=BLOCKED)
  ↓

When schema task completes → JWT and password tasks unblocked (status=READY)
When both JWT and password complete → login endpoint unblocked (status=READY)

Implementation agents execute tasks in priority order
```

### Priority Calculation Example

```python
# Task submitted by human with 1-hour deadline, blocking 5 other tasks
task = Task(
    prompt="Critical bug fix",
    priority=8,  # Base priority
    source=TaskSource.HUMAN,
    deadline=datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=1),
    blocking_tasks=[task1_id, task2_id, task3_id, task4_id, task5_id]
)

calculated_priority = (
    8 * 1.0        # Base priority: 8.0
    + 8.0 * 2.0    # Urgency (1 hour deadline): 16.0
    + 3.5 * 1.5    # Dependency boost (5 blocked tasks): 5.25
    + 0.0 * 0.5    # Starvation (just submitted): 0.0
    + 2.0 * 1.0    # Source (HUMAN): 2.0
)
# = 31.25 (high priority, will execute soon)
```

## Risks and Mitigations

**Risk 1: Circular Dependency Detection Performance**
- Mitigation: DFS is O(V+E), cache graph in memory, limit depth to 10
- Contingency: If >100ms, implement graph caching with TTL

**Risk 2: Database Lock Contention**
- Mitigation: WAL mode, short transactions, batch updates
- Contingency: Consider PostgreSQL if SQLite limits hit

**Risk 3: Priority Recalculation Overhead**
- Mitigation: Only recalc PENDING/BLOCKED/READY tasks, periodic (not real-time)
- Contingency: Make frequency configurable, increase interval under load

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 10-12 days (with default decisions)
- Phase 1 (Schema): 2 days
- Phase 2 (Dependency): 3 days
- Phase 3 (Priority): 2 days
