## Key Concepts

### Task Lifecycle States
```
PENDING → BLOCKED → READY → RUNNING → COMPLETED
                                       ↘ FAILED
                                       ↘ CANCELLED
```

### Task Sources (Priority Order)
1. HUMAN (highest priority, base boost +2.0)
2. AGENT_REQUIREMENTS (boost +1.5)
3. AGENT_PLANNER (boost +1.0)
4. AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION (boost +0.5)

### Dependency Types
- **SEQUENTIAL:** Task B waits for Task A
- **PARALLEL:** Task C waits for ALL of [A, B]

### Priority Calculation Formula
```
Priority = base_priority * 1.0
           + urgency_score * 2.0        (deadline proximity)
           + dependency_score * 1.5     (how many tasks blocked)
           + starvation_score * 0.5     (wait time boost)
           + source_score * 1.0         (HUMAN vs AGENT)
```

## Performance Targets

| Operation | Target | Validation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Task enqueue | 1000+ tasks/sec | Benchmark: insert 10k tasks |
| Dependency resolution | <10ms for 100 tasks | Benchmark: cycle detection |
| Priority calculation | <5ms per task | Benchmark: 1000 calculations |
| Dequeue next task | <5ms | Query plan + benchmark |
| Complete task + unblock | <20ms | Transaction timing |
