3. Minor coverage gaps in error paths (LOW - acceptable)

### Risks Mitigated
1. Circular dependency detection (MITIGATED - comprehensive tests)
2. Database lock contention (MITIGATED - short transactions, WAL mode)
3. Priority recalculation overhead (MITIGATED - efficient queries, indexes)
4. Complex dependency graphs (MITIGATED - depth limits, validation)

### Current Risk Level: LOW
No critical or high-severity risks identified. System ready for production use.
