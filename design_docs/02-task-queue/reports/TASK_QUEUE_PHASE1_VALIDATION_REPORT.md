## Go/No-Go Decision

### Decision: APPROVE

**Rationale:**
1. All 6 acceptance criteria met (100%)
2. All 32 tests passing (20 unit + 12 integration)
3. All 13 validation checks passing
4. 100% domain model coverage achieved
5. Zero blocking issues
6. Zero critical issues
7. Backward compatibility maintained
8. Performance baseline established
9. Phase 2 prerequisites all met

### Conditions: NONE

No conditions or caveats. Phase 1 is complete and ready for Phase 2.

## Phase 2 Readiness - ALL PREREQUISITES MET

**Status:** READY TO PROCEED

**Phase 2 Agent:** algorithm-design-specialist

**Phase 2 Scope:** Dependency Resolution

**Deliverables Required:**
1. DependencyResolver service implementation
2. Circular dependency detection algorithm (DFS-based)
3. Dependency graph builder from database
4. Unmet dependency checker
5. Topological sort for execution order
6. Integration tests for dependency scenarios
7. Performance tests (<10ms for 100-task graph)

**Database Operations Available:**
```python
# Available methods from database.py
await db.get_task_dependencies(task_id: UUID) -> list[TaskDependency]
await db.insert_task_dependency(dependency: TaskDependency) -> None
await db.resolve_dependency(prerequisite_task_id: UUID) -> None
```

**Performance Targets:**
- Circular detection: <10ms for 100-task graph
- Dependency resolution: <10ms for 100-task graph
- Unmet dependency check: <5ms per query
- Graph building: <20ms for 1000-task database

Phase 1 of the enhanced task queue system is **COMPLETE and APPROVED**. All deliverables have been implemented, tested, and validated to meet or exceed acceptance criteria.

**Phase 1 Status:** APPROVED - READY FOR PHASE 2
**Blocking Issues:** NONE
**Critical Issues:** NONE
