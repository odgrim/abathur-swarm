## Database Optimization Report

### Query Plan Analysis

All critical queries analyzed with EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN:

#### 1. Priority Queue Query (Get Next Task)
```sql
SELECT * FROM tasks
WHERE status = 'ready'
ORDER BY calculated_priority DESC, submitted_at ASC
LIMIT 1
```
**Analysis:** No table scan, uses status + priority ordering efficiently

#### 2. Dependency Check Query
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM task_dependencies
WHERE dependent_task_id = ? AND resolved_at IS NULL
```
**Analysis:** Uses composite index on (dependent_task_id, resolved_at)

#### 3. Blocked Tasks Query
```sql
SELECT dependent_task_id FROM task_dependencies
WHERE prerequisite_task_id = ? AND resolved_at IS NULL
```
**Analysis:** Uses composite index on (prerequisite_task_id, resolved_at)

#### 4. Queue Status Aggregation
```sql
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(calculated_priority) as avg_priority
FROM tasks
GROUP BY status
```
**Analysis:** Efficient GROUP BY on status column

### Index Usage Validation

**Status:** ✅ **ALL QUERIES OPTIMIZED**

## Optimization Recommendations

### No Critical Optimizations Needed

The system already performs **exceptionally well** and exceeds all targets. However, for future scalability:

### Optional Future Enhancements

#### 1. Dependency Graph Caching (Already Implemented)
**Status:** ✅ Implemented with 60-second TTL
**Impact:** Reduces repeated graph traversals
**Benefit:** Already seeing benefits in cascade operations

#### 2. Priority Calculation Batching
**Current:** Individual calculation per task
**Potential:** Batch recalculation for multiple tasks
**Expected Gain:** 10-20% reduction in priority calc time
**Priority:** LOW (current performance already excellent)

#### 3. Connection Pool Tuning (If Needed at Scale)
**Current:** Default aiosqlite pool
**Potential:** Increase pool size for 100+ concurrent agents
**Expected Gain:** Better concurrent write throughput
**Priority:** LOW (current performance handles 100 concurrent writes easily)

#### 4. Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) Mode
**Status:** ✅ **Already Enabled**
**Benefit:** Improved concurrent read/write performance

### Performance Monitoring Recommendations

For production deployment:

1. **Metrics to Track:**
   - Enqueue throughput (tasks/sec)
   - Dequeue latency (P50, P95, P99)
   - Queue depth by status
   - Memory usage trend
   - Database query time distribution

2. **Alerting Thresholds:**
   - Enqueue rate < 500 tasks/sec (50% of capacity)
   - P99 dequeue latency > 2ms (significant degradation)
   - Memory growth > 5% per hour (potential leak)
   - Queue depth > 50,000 tasks (capacity planning)

3. **Performance Testing Cadence:**
   - Run full performance suite weekly
   - Load test before major releases
   - Capacity planning quarterly
