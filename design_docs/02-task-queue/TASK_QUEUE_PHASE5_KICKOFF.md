## Coordination Instructions

### How to Invoke Agents

**For the user to start Phase 5, they should invoke agents using:**

```
[test-automation-engineer] Please start Phase 5 work. Read the Phase 5 context document at:
/Users/odgrim/dev/home/agentics/abathur/design_docs/02-task-queue/TASK_QUEUE_PHASE5_CONTEXT.md

Your task: Create comprehensive end-to-end test suite covering multi-agent workflows, complex dependency graphs, failure scenarios, stress tests, and memory integration. Target: 100% workflow coverage.
```

```
[performance-optimization-specialist] Please start Phase 5 work. Read the Phase 5 context document at:
/Users/odgrim/dev/home/agentics/abathur/design_docs/02-task-queue/TASK_QUEUE_PHASE5_CONTEXT.md

Your task: Perform final system-wide performance validation, load testing with 10,000+ tasks, memory profiling, and bottleneck analysis. Validate all performance targets met at system level.
```

```
[technical-documentation-writer] Please start Phase 5 work. Read the Phase 5 context document at:
/Users/odgrim/dev/home/agentics/abathur/design_docs/02-task-queue/TASK_QUEUE_PHASE5_CONTEXT.md

Your task: Create complete documentation package including user guide, API reference, architecture overview, migration guide, troubleshooting guide, and implement dependency visualizer (GraphViz/Mermaid export).
```

## Success Criteria

### Final Acceptance Criteria (All Must Pass)

1. All end-to-end tests passing (100% workflow coverage)
2. All system-wide performance tests passing (targets met under load)
3. Complete documentation package delivered and validated
4. Dependency visualization implemented and working
5. No critical or blocking issues identified
6. All 8 original acceptance criteria validated at system level
7. System stable and production-ready

### Final Gate Decision Options

- APPROVE: System ready for production use
- CONDITIONAL: Minor issues, proceed with monitoring
- REVISE: Return to specific phase for fixes
- ESCALATE: Require human review before deployment
