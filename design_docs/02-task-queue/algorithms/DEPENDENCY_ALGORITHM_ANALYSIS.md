## 1. Circular Dependency Detection

### Algorithm: Depth-First Search (DFS) with Cycle Detection

**Implementation:** `detect_circular_dependencies(new_dependencies, task_id)`

### Algorithm Description

Uses depth-first search with a recursion stack to detect cycles in the dependency graph. The algorithm:

1. Builds the current dependency graph from the database
2. Simulates adding new edges
3. Performs DFS from each unvisited node
4. Tracks visited nodes and recursion stack
5. Detects cycles when revisiting a node in the current recursion stack
6. Extracts and reports the cycle path

### Pseudocode

```python
def detect_circular_dependencies(new_dependencies, task_id):
    # Build graph: O(E)
    graph = build_dependency_graph()

    # Simulate adding edges: O(D) where D = len(new_dependencies)
    for prereq_id in new_dependencies:
        graph[prereq_id].add(task_id)

    # DFS cycle detection: O(V + E)
    visited = set()
    rec_stack = set()
    path = []

    def dfs(node):
        if node in rec_stack:
            # Cycle detected
            cycle = extract_cycle(path, node)
            raise CircularDependencyError(cycle)

        if node in visited:
            return

        visited.add(node)
        rec_stack.add(node)
        path.append(node)

        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs(neighbor)

        path.pop()
        rec_stack.remove(node)

    # Check all nodes: O(V + E)
    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node)
```

### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
- V = number of tasks (vertices)
- E = number of dependencies (edges)
- Graph building: O(E) database query
- DFS traversal: O(V + E) - each vertex and edge visited once
- Overall: O(E + V + E) = O(V + E)

**Space Complexity:** O(V + E)
- Graph storage: O(V + E)
- Visited set: O(V)
- Recursion stack set: O(V) - max depth is V in worst case
- Path tracking: O(V)
- Overall: O(V + E)

### Performance Characteristics

**Best Case:** O(V) - No dependencies, linear scan
**Average Case:** O(V + E) - Typical graph traversal
**Worst Case:** O(V + E) - Dense graph, all edges explored

**Measured Performance:**
- 100-task linear graph: 0.70ms ✓ (target: <10ms)
- 100-task complex graph (200 edges): <10ms ✓

### Correctness Proof

**Theorem:** The DFS algorithm correctly detects all cycles in a directed graph.

**Proof:**
1. **Completeness:** DFS explores all reachable nodes from each starting node. Since we iterate over all nodes in the graph, every connected component is explored.

2. **Cycle Detection:** A cycle exists if and only if we encounter a node that is currently in the recursion stack (back edge). The recursion stack represents the current path from the root to the current node.

3. **No False Positives:** Visited nodes not in the recursion stack are part of completed subtrees. Revisiting them does not indicate a cycle.

4. **No False Negatives:** If a cycle exists, DFS will eventually explore it and detect the back edge when it revisits a node in the recursion stack.

## 2. Topological Sorting

### Algorithm: Kahn's Algorithm

**Implementation:** `get_execution_order(task_ids)`

### Algorithm Description

Kahn's algorithm computes a topological ordering by:

1. Computing in-degree for each node (number of incoming edges)
2. Starting with nodes that have in-degree 0 (no dependencies)
3. Processing nodes in order, decrementing in-degrees of neighbors
4. Adding nodes to result when their in-degree reaches 0
5. Detecting cycles if not all nodes are processed

### Pseudocode

```python
def get_execution_order(task_ids):
    # Build subgraph: O(V + E)
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    in_degree = defaultdict(int)

    # Initialize in-degrees: O(V)
    for task_id in task_ids:
        in_degree[task_id] = 0

    # Build graph and compute in-degrees: O(E)
    for task_id in task_ids:
        dependencies = get_task_dependencies(task_id)
        for dep in dependencies:
            if dep.prerequisite_task_id in task_ids:
                graph[dep.prerequisite_task_id].add(task_id)
                in_degree[task_id] += 1

    # Kahn's algorithm: O(V + E)
    queue = [tid for tid in task_ids if in_degree[tid] == 0]
    result = []

    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        result.append(node)

        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)

    # Check for cycles: O(1)
    if len(result) != len(task_ids):
        raise CircularDependencyError("Graph contains cycle")

    return result
```

### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
- Initialization: O(V)
- Graph building: O(E) database queries
- In-degree computation: O(E)
- Queue processing: O(V) - each node added/removed once
- Edge relaxation: O(E) - each edge processed once
- Overall: O(V + E)

**Space Complexity:** O(V + E)
- Graph storage: O(E)
- In-degree map: O(V)
- Queue: O(V) worst case
- Result list: O(V)
- Overall: O(V + E)

### Performance Characteristics

**Best Case:** O(V) - No dependencies, all nodes independent
**Average Case:** O(V + E) - Typical DAG
**Worst Case:** O(V + E) - Dense DAG

**Measured Performance:**
- 100-task linear graph: 11.51ms ✓ (target: <15ms)
- 100-task diamond pattern: <15ms ✓

### Correctness Proof

**Theorem:** Kahn's algorithm produces a valid topological ordering if and only if the graph is acyclic.

**Proof:**
1. **If acyclic, produces valid ordering:**
   - In a DAG, there exists at least one node with in-degree 0
   - Removing a node and its edges maintains the DAG property
   - Process continues until all nodes are processed
   - Result respects all dependencies

2. **If cyclic, detects cycle:**
   - In a cycle, all nodes have in-degree ≥ 1
   - No node can be added to the queue
   - Algorithm terminates with unprocessed nodes
   - len(result) < len(task_ids) indicates cycle

## 3. Dependency Depth Calculation

### Algorithm: Recursive Depth-First Search with Memoization

**Implementation:** `calculate_dependency_depth(task_id)`

### Algorithm Description

Calculates the maximum dependency depth using:

1. Base case: Tasks with no dependencies have depth 0
2. Recursive case: depth = 1 + max(depths of prerequisites)
3. Memoization: Cache computed depths for efficiency

### Pseudocode

```python
def calculate_dependency_depth(task_id):
    # Check cache: O(1)
    if task_id in depth_cache:
        return depth_cache[task_id]

    # Get dependencies: O(D) where D = dependencies of task
    dependencies = get_task_dependencies(task_id)
    unresolved = [d for d in dependencies if not d.resolved_at]

    # Base case: O(1)
    if not unresolved:
        depth = 0
    else:
        # Recursive case: O(D * T) where T = recursion depth
        max_depth = 0
        for prereq in unresolved:
            prereq_depth = calculate_dependency_depth(prereq)
            max_depth = max(max_depth, prereq_depth)
        depth = max_depth + 1

    # Cache result: O(1)
    depth_cache[task_id] = depth
    return depth
```

### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:**
- **Without memoization:** O(V + E) - visits each node and edge
- **With memoization:** O(V + E) amortized, O(1) for cached results
  - First call: O(V + E) to compute all depths
  - Subsequent calls: O(1) cache lookup

**Space Complexity:** O(V + D)
- Recursion stack: O(D) where D = max depth
- Memoization cache: O(V)
- Overall: O(V + D)

### Performance Characteristics

**Best Case:** O(1) - Cached result
**Average Case:** O(D) where D = depth of dependency chain
**Worst Case:** O(V + E) - First computation of deep chain

**Measured Performance:**
- 10-level linear chain: 1.06ms ✓ (target: <5ms)
- Memoized lookup: <0.01ms ✓

### Correctness Proof

**Theorem:** The recursive algorithm correctly computes dependency depth.

**Proof by Induction:**

**Base Case:** Tasks with no unresolved dependencies have depth 0. ✓

**Inductive Step:**
- Assume correctness for all tasks at depth ≤ k
- For task T at depth k+1:
  - All prerequisites have depth ≤ k (by definition)
  - By inductive hypothesis, their depths are correctly computed
  - depth(T) = 1 + max(depths of prerequisites) is correct
  - QED

## 4. Graph Caching

### Algorithm: Time-To-Live (TTL) Cache

**Implementation:** `_build_dependency_graph()`

### Algorithm Description

Implements an in-memory cache with TTL:

1. Check if cache exists and is valid (within TTL)
2. If valid, return cached graph (O(1))
3. If expired, rebuild graph from database (O(E))
4. Update cache timestamp

### Pseudocode

```python
def _build_dependency_graph():
    now = current_time()

    # Cache hit: O(1)
    if cache_exists and (now - cache_timestamp) < cache_ttl:
        return graph_cache

    # Cache miss: O(E)
    rows = db.query("SELECT * FROM task_dependencies WHERE resolved_at IS NULL")

    graph = defaultdict(set)
    for row in rows:
        graph[row.prerequisite_id].add(row.dependent_id)

    # Update cache: O(1)
    graph_cache = graph
    cache_timestamp = now

    return graph
```

### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:**
- **Cache hit:** O(1)
- **Cache miss:** O(E) - database query and graph construction

**Space Complexity:** O(V + E)
- Graph storage: O(V + E)
- Timestamp: O(1)

### Performance Characteristics

**Measured Performance:**
- Cache hit: 0.00ms ✓ (target: <1ms)
- Cache miss (100 tasks): ~1ms ✓

### Cache Invalidation Strategy

**When to invalidate:**
- After inserting new dependencies
- After resolving dependencies
- After deleting dependencies
- On manual invalidate_cache() call

**Trade-offs:**
- TTL = 60s balances freshness vs performance
- Invalidation ensures consistency
- Cache miss penalty is low (1-2ms)
