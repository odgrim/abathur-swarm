"""Integration tests for TUI Task Tree parent-child relationships.

Tests complete end-to-end workflows for multi-level task hierarchies:
- Independent expand/collapse at each level (FR003)
- Expanding parent doesn't auto-expand children
- Visibility control at each hierarchy level

    """Expanding parent doesn't auto-expand children.

    This test validates FR003 requirement that each hierarchy level
    maintains independent expand/collapse state. Expanding a parent
    node should make its direct children visible, but those children
    should remain collapsed until explicitly expanded.

    Test Structure:
        Root (collapsed initially)
        ├─ Child 1A (not visible, collapsed)
        │  └─ Grandchild 1A1 (not visible)
        └─ Child 1B (not visible)

    Test Steps:
        1. Expand root → Children visible but collapsed
        2. Verify Child 1A is visible but NOT expanded
        3. Verify Grandchild is NOT visible (parent collapsed)
        4. Expand Child 1A → Grandchild becomes visible
        5. Verify Grandchild is now visible

    Expected Behavior:
        - Expanding root makes children visible
        - Children remain collapsed (not auto-expanded)
        - Grandchildren remain hidden until their parent is expanded
        - Each level maintains independent expand/collapse state
