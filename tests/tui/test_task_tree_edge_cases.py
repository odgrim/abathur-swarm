"""Edge case tests for TaskTreeWidget hierarchical display.

Tests edge cases and unusual scenarios in parent-child relationships:
- Three-level nesting (grandparent → parent → child)
- Parent with zero children (should display normally)
- Parent with large number of children (e.g., 50 children)
- Navigation across three levels
- Independent expand/collapse states
- Missing parents (orphaned child tasks)
- Orphaned tasks (parent_task_id references non-existent task)
- Parametrized tests for various child counts (0, 1, 5, 10, 50)
