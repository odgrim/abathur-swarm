"""System-wide performance validation and benchmarks for Phase 5B.

This module provides comprehensive system-level performance testing including:
- Load testing with 10,000+ tasks
- Concurrent operation benchmarks
- Memory profiling and leak detection
- Database query performance validation
- Bottleneck analysis and profiling

Performance Targets (System-Level):
- Task enqueue throughput: >1000 tasks/sec
- Task dequeue latency: <5ms (p99)
- Complete task cascade: <50ms for 10 dependents
- Memory usage: <500MB for 10,000 tasks
- Database connections: Efficient connection pool reuse
- No memory leaks
