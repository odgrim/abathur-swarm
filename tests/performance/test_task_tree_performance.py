"""Performance tests for TaskTreeWidget rendering and navigation.

Benchmarks critical operations and verifies performance targets:
- 100 task render time (target: <100ms)
- 1000 task render scalability (target: <1s)
- Navigation performance with 100+ tasks (target: <50ms per action)
- Memory usage with large task lists (target: <50MB for 1000 tasks)

Performance Targets:
- Task tree render (100 tasks): <100ms
- Task tree render (1000 tasks): <1s
- Navigation (up/down/expand/collapse): <50ms per action
- Memory overhead: <50MB for 1000 tasks

# Fixtures from conftest.py are automatically discovered by pytest


# Tests will be implemented in later tasks (Phase 4)
