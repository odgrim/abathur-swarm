"""Comprehensive functional tests for TUI Task Queue Visualizer and Prune functionality.

Tests complete end-to-end workflows for:
- FR001: Recursive status checking for task hierarchies
- FR002: Leaves-to-root deletion order enforcement
- FR003: Partial tree preservation (parent match/child no-match scenarios)
- FR004: Leaf task independence (can delete without affecting parents)
- FR005: Preview dry-run mode (show what will be deleted without deleting)
- FR006: Progress feedback for large task trees (100+ tasks)

This test suite validates that the task pruning functionality correctly handles
complex task dependency graphs, enforces deletion ordering, and provides
appropriate user feedback.
