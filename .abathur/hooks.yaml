# Task Hook System Configuration
#
# This file defines lifecycle hooks that execute at specific events during task and branch lifecycle.
# Hooks enable automation of workflows like auto-merging branches, validation checks, and notifications.

  - id: auto-merge-successful-task-branch
    description: "Automatically spawn merge orchestrator when all tasks in a branch succeed"
    event:
      on_branch_complete:
        branch_type: task_branch
    conditions:
      - all_tasks_succeeded: true
        min_tasks_completed: 1
        branch_pattern: "^task/.*"
    actions:

          # Merge Task Branch into Feature Branch

          ## Branch Details
          - Task Branch: ${branch_name}
          - Feature Branch: ${feature_branch}
          - Total Tasks: ${total_tasks}
          - All Succeeded: ${all_succeeded}

          ## Completed Tasks
          ${completed_task_ids}

          ## Your Mission
          1. Verify all tests pass in task branch worktree
          2. Merge task branch into feature branch
          3. Run integration tests on feature branch
          4. Clean up task branch and worktree if merge succeeds

          ## Safety Checks
          - Verify no conflicts exist
          - Ensure all commits are present
          - Run post-merge validation

  - id: notify-branch-failures
    description: "Spawn failure analyst when branch completes with failures"
    event:
      on_branch_complete:
        branch_type: task_branch
    conditions:
      - all_tasks_succeeded: false
        branch_pattern: "^task/.*"

          # Branch Failure Analysis

          ## Failed Branch
          - Branch: ${branch_name}
          - Feature Branch: ${feature_branch}
          - Total Tasks: ${total_tasks}
          - Failed Tasks: ${failed_task_count}

          ## Your Mission
          1. Review failed tasks: ${failed_task_ids}
          2. Analyze root cause of failures
          3. Determine if failures are related
          4. Recommend remediation strategy:
             - Can we salvage completed work?
             - Should we retry failed tasks?
             - Is the entire branch approach flawed?
          5. Create recovery plan

          ## Recovery Options
          - Option A: Fix failed tasks and continue
          - Option B: Rollback and restart with new approach
          - Option C: Abandon branch and document learnings
