## Diátaxis Framework Context

**How-to guides are problem-oriented**: They help you accomplish specific goals and solve particular problems. Unlike tutorials that teach through learning journeys, how-to guides get straight to the solution.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Goal-focused**: Each guide targets a specific problem or objective
- **Practical**: Direct, actionable steps without unnecessary explanation
- **Multiple approaches**: When relevant, presents alternatives and trade-offs
- **Assumes knowledge**: Expects basic familiarity with Abathur concepts
- **Concise**: Minimal theory, maximum action

**When to Use How-To Guides**:
- You have a specific problem to solve
- You know what you want to accomplish
- You need a quick solution or recipe
- You're already familiar with basic concepts
- You want to see different approaches to a problem
