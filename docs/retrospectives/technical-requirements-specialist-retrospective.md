# Technical Requirements Specialist Retrospective Analysis
## Task Summary Field Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: Task Summary Field for Task Queue
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Analysis Scope**: Agent behavior, workflow efficiency, context provision, and improvement opportunities

---

## Executive Summary

This retrospective analyzes the technical-requirements-specialist agent's performance during the task summary field implementation. The agent was invoked **10 times** across multiple attempts to create technical specifications for the same feature, revealing significant inefficiencies in the workflow and agent orchestration.

### Key Findings

**STRENGTHS:**
- ✅ Comprehensive technical specifications produced
- ✅ Proper architectural analysis following Clean Architecture
- ✅ Complete implementation phase breakdown
- ✅ Thorough technical decisions with rationale
- ✅ Rich context provided to downstream agents (when spawned)

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
- ❌ **Agent was invoked 10 times for the same feature** (massive inefficiency)
- ❌ **Memory storage patterns inconsistent** - some tasks stored to memory, others did not
- ❌ **Task-planner received 5+ different prompts** for identical work
- ❌ **No coordination mechanism** to prevent duplicate work
- ❌ **Agent instructions unclear** about when to store to memory vs. write files
- ❌ **Excessive iteration** on completed work (retrospective documentation)

---

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Agent Invocation Patterns

#### Task IDs and Status
From the task queue, 10 technical-requirements-specialist tasks were identified:

1. `f1937b5d-582c-4241-bd4a-c37ee5a47285` - Technical Requirements Analysis (COMPLETED)
2. `0697182f-0f39-4081-ba79-f4794f771e6b` - Technical Specification Work (COMPLETED)
3. `ec940a4b-fa1a-4544-bd02-72ad2479016e` - Technical Specification Development (COMPLETED)
4. `039fd34c-63ab-4994-a315-b85a5961334b` - Create comprehensive technical spec documentation (COMPLETED)
5. `7c9a705c-aa62-45ca-b365-812a3b42e4cc` - Create comprehensive technical specifications (COMPLETED)
6. `d0842ab9-6274-4fe8-b3a6-868338464ab4` - **Retrospective** technical specification (COMPLETED)
7. `209c2c64-126b-4f9f-ab95-3e1482572d88` - Technical Requirements Analysis (COMPLETED)
8. `d2a291c2-4821-457b-a827-aa274254541d` - Technical Requirements Analysis (COMPLETED)
9. `bf689961-5d3b-4aea-81bf-c74c6eaa5bba` - Technical Requirements Analysis Task (COMPLETED)
10. `6cd9b0a8-b186-4ec0-bd67-8688f87beb59` - Technical Specification Analysis (COMPLETED)

**Problem**: All 10 tasks were essentially creating technical specifications for the SAME feature (task summary field). This represents a 10x redundancy issue.

### 2. Context Provision Analysis

#### What the Agent DID WELL

**Comprehensive Technical Specifications:**
```json
{
  "architecture": {
    "overview": "Clean Architecture with vertical slice...",
    "components": [/* detailed component specs */],
    "patterns": [/* architectural patterns */],
    "diagrams": "Data flow documentation"
  },
  "data_models": [/* complete field specifications */],
  "apis": [/* MCP tool schemas and examples */],
  "technical_decisions": [/* decisions with rationale */]
}
```

**Rich Context for Task-Planner:**
The agent provided excellent context in prompts:
- ✅ Architecture overview summaries
- ✅ Implementation phase breakdown with estimates
- ✅ Component-level details with file locations and line numbers
- ✅ Memory namespace references
- ✅ Suggested agent specializations
- ✅ Technical constraints and success criteria

**Example from Task `2eb151a1-f166-41d7-8611-b10ae7769bef`:**
```markdown
## Implementation Phases
**Phase 1: Domain Model Update** (10 min)
- Add summary field to Task model in src/abathur/domain/models.py:39-88
- Pydantic Field validation: max_length=200, optional/nullable
- Verify syntax and imports

**Phase 2: Database Migration** (15 min)
- Add migration in src/abathur/infrastructure/database.py:144-238
...

## Memory References
- Technical specifications: task:6cd9b0a8-b186-4ec0-bd67-8688f87beb59:technical_specs
  - Keys: architecture, data_models, api_specifications...
```

This is **EXCELLENT** context provision - specific, actionable, with precise file locations.

#### What the Agent DID POORLY

**Memory Storage Inconsistency:**
- ❌ Only ~3 of 10 tasks stored technical specifications to memory
- ❌ No consistent namespace pattern
- ❌ Some tasks wrote to files instead of memory
- ❌ No deduplication check before creating new specs

**No Coordination Between Invocations:**
- ❌ Each invocation treated the feature as net-new work
- ❌ No check for existing technical specifications
- ❌ No reuse of prior analysis
- ❌ No mechanism to say "specs already exist, see task:X"

**Excessive Iteration:**
Task `d0842ab9-6274-4fe8-b3a6-868338464ab4` was marked as **"RETROSPECTIVE"** technical specification:
```
"This is a **retrospective technical specification** for the completed task
summary field feature. The implementation is COMPLETE and deployed on feature
branch 'feature/task-summary-field'."
```

**Problem**: Why create retrospective technical specifications? The agent instructions don't call for documenting completed work - they focus on creating specs for upcoming implementation.

### 3. Task-Planner Context Analysis

#### Context Provided to Task-Planner

The technical-requirements-specialist spawned task-planner **5 times**:

1. Task `2eb151a1-f166-41d7-8611-b10ae7769bef` - Comprehensive context ✅
2. Task `a85877e4-f94e-4be8-a50d-a4304fb174a2` - Comprehensive context ✅
3. Task `afd1ac25-ef0f-41ca-884b-7030f9cd44fb` - **Special case** (95% complete, only 2 lines remaining)
4. Multiple other invocations with similar context

**Quality Assessment**: ✅ **EXCELLENT**

Example context structure:
```markdown
## Architecture Overview
- **Style**: Layered Architecture (Domain → Infrastructure → Service → MCP API)
- **Complexity**: Low (6-8 hours total)
- **Changes Flow**: Task Model → Database Schema → Database CRUD → Service Layer → MCP Tools

## Implementation Phases (detailed breakdown with estimates)
## Components to Implement (with file paths and line numbers)
## Data Models (complete field specifications)
## APIs/Interfaces (request/response schemas)
## Technical Constraints (backward compatibility, performance)
## Suggested Agent Specializations (with task type mappings)
## Memory References (with namespace and keys)
## Expected Output (clear deliverables)
## Success Criteria (testable conditions)
```

**This is exemplary context provision** - the task-planner received everything needed to decompose tasks effectively.

### 4. Agent Specialization Suggestions

#### Suggested Agents

The technical-requirements-specialist consistently suggested these specialized agents:

```json
{
  "pydantic_models": {
    "suggested_agent_type": "python-pydantic-model-specialist",
    "expertise": "Adding fields to Pydantic V2 models with proper Field validation",
    "task_types": ["Add optional field to domain model", "Configure Pydantic Field validation"]
  },
  "database_migrations": {
    "suggested_agent_type": "sqlite-migration-specialist",
    "expertise": "SQLite schema migrations with idempotency and backward compatibility",
    "task_types": ["Add column to existing table", "Create idempotent migration"]
  },
  "mcp_tools": {
    "suggested_agent_type": "mcp-tool-schema-specialist",
    "expertise": "Updating MCP server tool schemas and request handlers",
    "task_types": ["Add parameter to MCP tool schema", "Update tool handler"]
  },
  "vertical_slice": {
    "suggested_agent_type": "python-task-queue-feature-specialist",
    "expertise": "Implementing complete task queue features across all layers",
    "task_types": ["Implement complete vertical slice feature"]
  }
}
```

**Assessment**: ✅ **GOOD** - Clear agent specializations with responsibilities

**However**: Several of these agents already exist in `.claude/agents/workers/`:
- `python-pydantic-model-specialist.md` ✅
- `sqlite-migration-specialist.md` ✅
- `mcp-tool-schema-specialist.md` ✅
- `python-task-queue-feature-specialist.md` ✅

**Problem**: Agent didn't check for existing agents before suggesting. Per instructions:
> "The task-planner will: Determine which specific agents are needed during task decomposition"

But the tech-requirements-specialist could optimize by referencing existing agents.

### 5. Implementation Plan Quality

#### Phase Breakdown Example (Task `0697182f-0f39-4081-ba79-f4794f771e6b`)

```json
{
  "phases": [
    {
      "phase_name": "Phase 1: Domain Model Update",
      "objectives": ["Add summary field to Task model", "Implement Pydantic validation"],
      "tasks": [
        "Add summary: str | None field to Task model",
        "Configure Field validator with max_length=500",
        "Add description for field documentation",
        "Verify Pydantic validation works"
      ],
      "dependencies": [],
      "estimated_effort": "30 minutes",
      "status": "COMPLETED"
    },
    // ... 5 more phases with similar detail
  ]
}
```

**Quality**: ✅ **EXCELLENT**
- Clear phase objectives
- Actionable tasks
- Realistic estimates
- Proper dependencies
- Testable completion criteria

### 6. Research Findings

The agent conducted research and documented findings:

```json
{
  "research_findings": [
    {
      "topic": "Database Schema Design Best Practices (2025)",
      "findings": "Modern database schema design emphasizes...",
      "sources": ["Stack Overflow", "Integrate.io", "Airbyte"],
      "application": "Summary field uses TEXT type..."
    },
    {
      "topic": "Idempotent Database Migrations",
      "findings": "Idempotent migrations are critical for reliability...",
      "application": "Migration checks column existence via PRAGMA table_info..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Quality**: ✅ **GOOD**
- Evidence-based decisions
- Real sources cited
- Clear application to project

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Duplicate Work (10x Redundancy)

**Problem**: Agent invoked 10 times for same feature.

**Root Causes**:
1. **No memory search before starting** - Agent instructions say "Load Requirements from Memory" but don't say "Check if technical specs already exist"
2. **No task queue coordination** - No mechanism to check for in-flight or completed tech-spec tasks
3. **Upstream agents spawning redundantly** - requirements-gatherer or technical-architect may have spawned multiple times

**Impact**:
- Wasted compute time (10x redundancy)
- Confused task queue with duplicate tasks
- Risk of inconsistent specifications

**Recommendation**:
```python
# Add to agent instructions STEP 0:
"""
0. **Check for Existing Technical Specifications**
   Before starting work, search for existing technical specifications:

   ```python
   # Search for prior technical specs for this feature
   prior_specs = memory_search({
       "namespace_prefix": f"task:*:technical_specs",
       "memory_type": "semantic",
       "limit": 10
   })

   # Check task queue for in-flight technical-requirements-specialist tasks
   in_flight_tasks = task_list({
       "agent_type": "technical-requirements-specialist",
       "status": "running"
   })

   # If specifications already exist and are recent (< 24 hours):
   if existing_specs_found and not outdated:
       return {
           "status": "SPECIFICATIONS_EXIST",
           "existing_task_id": prior_task_id,
           "namespace": existing_namespace,
           "recommendation": "Reuse existing specifications rather than duplicating work"
       }
   ```
"""
```

### Issue 2: Memory Storage Inconsistency

**Problem**: Only ~30% of tasks stored to memory, others wrote files.

**Root Cause**: Agent instructions are ambiguous:
> "Store Technical Specifications in Memory"

But then show examples of both memory storage AND file creation.

**Impact**:
- Inconsistent data storage
- Task-planner can't reliably find technical specs
- Some specs in memory, some in files, some in both

**Recommendation**:
- **Clarify**: Memory is PRIMARY storage, files are SECONDARY documentation
- **Enforce**: Add validation that memory storage completed before spawning task-planner
- **Template**: Provide clear memory schema with required keys

```python
# Required memory storage structure:
REQUIRED_MEMORY_KEYS = [
    "architecture",
    "data_models",
    "api_specifications",
    "technical_decisions",
    "implementation_plan",
    "suggested_agent_specializations"
]

# Validate before spawning task-planner:
for key in REQUIRED_MEMORY_KEYS:
    assert memory_get(namespace=f"task:{tech_spec_task_id}:technical_specs", key=key)
```

### Issue 3: No Agent Existence Check

**Problem**: Suggested agent specializations without checking `.claude/agents/` directory.

**Root Cause**: Agent instructions say:
> "Suggested Agent Specializations Identification - You do NOT create agents here"

But don't say "Check which agents already exist first".

**Impact**:
- Redundant agent suggestions
- Task-planner has to re-check existence
- Potential confusion about which agents to use

**Recommendation**:
```python
# Add to agent instructions STEP 9:
"""
9. **Check Existing Agents Before Suggesting**
   Before documenting suggested agent specializations:

   ```python
   # List existing agents
   existing_agents = glob(".claude/agents/**/*.md")
   agent_names = [extract_agent_name(path) for path in existing_agents]

   # For each suggested agent, check if it exists:
   suggested_agents = {}
   for task_type, agent_spec in potential_agents.items():
       agent_exists = agent_spec["suggested_agent_type"] in agent_names
       suggested_agents[task_type] = {
           **agent_spec,
           "exists": agent_exists,
           "path": f".claude/agents/workers/{agent_spec['suggested_agent_type']}.md" if agent_exists else None,
           "needs_creation": not agent_exists
       }
   ```
"""
```

### Issue 4: Retrospective Work Not in Scope

**Problem**: Task `d0842ab9` was "retrospective technical specification for completed feature".

**Root Cause**: Agent instructions don't explicitly prohibit retrospective documentation.

**Impact**:
- Wasted effort documenting already-completed work
- Confusion about agent purpose
- Task queue clutter

**Recommendation**:
- **Clarify scope**: "Only create technical specifications for UPCOMING implementations"
- **Add guard**: "If feature is already implemented and tested, exit with status: ALREADY_COMPLETE"

```python
# Add to agent instructions STEP 1.5:
"""
1.5 **Check Implementation Status**
    Before proceeding, verify this is not retrospective documentation:

    ```python
    # Check git for implementation evidence
    git_status = run("git log --oneline --grep='summary field' --all")

    # Check for existing tests
    test_files = glob("tests/**/test_*summary*.py")

    # If implementation exists:
    if git_status or test_files:
        return {
            "status": "FEATURE_ALREADY_IMPLEMENTED",
            "recommendation": "Use architecture-analysis for retrospective documentation, not technical-requirements-specialist"
        }
    ```
"""
```

## Positive Patterns Worth Preserving

### 1. Comprehensive Context for Downstream Agents ✅

The agent excelled at providing rich, actionable context to task-planner:
- Specific file paths and line numbers
- Estimated effort for each phase
- Clear success criteria
- Memory namespace references
- Suggested agent mappings to task types

**Preserve this pattern** - it enables effective task decomposition.

### 2. Evidence-Based Technical Decisions ✅

Research findings grounded decisions:
- Cited external sources (Stack Overflow, technical blogs)
- Explained rationale for each architectural choice
- Documented tradeoffs (pros/cons)
- Considered alternatives

**Preserve this pattern** - it creates maintainable, defensible architectures.

### 3. Complete Implementation Planning ✅

Phase breakdowns were thorough:
- 6-7 phases with clear objectives
- Dependencies between phases
- Realistic time estimates
- Testing strategy included

**Preserve this pattern** - it enables predictable execution.

### 4. Architectural Consistency ✅

All specifications followed Clean Architecture:
- Clear layer separation (Domain → Infrastructure → Service → API)
- Vertical slice approach
- Dependency rule enforcement

**Preserve this pattern** - it maintains codebase quality.

## Recommendations for Agent Improvement

### Priority 1: CRITICAL - Prevent Duplicate Work

**Problem**: 10x redundancy in technical specification creation.

**Solution**: Add deduplication checks at agent startup.

**Implementation**:
```markdown
## Instructions Update

### STEP 0: Deduplication Check (NEW)

Before starting any work, check for existing technical specifications:

1. **Search Memory for Prior Specs**
   ```python
   prior_specs = memory_search({
       "namespace_prefix": "task:",
       "memory_type": "semantic",
       "limit": 20
   })

   # Filter for technical specs related to this feature
   feature_keywords = extract_keywords_from_task_description()
   relevant_specs = [spec for spec in prior_specs
                     if any(keyword in spec['namespace'] for keyword in feature_keywords)]
   ```

2. **Check Task Queue for In-Flight Work**
   ```python
   in_flight = task_list({
       "agent_type": "technical-requirements-specialist",
       "status": ["pending", "running"]
   })

   # If found, determine if duplicate:
   for task in in_flight:
       if is_duplicate_work(task, current_task_description):
           return {
               "status": "DUPLICATE_WORK_DETECTED",
               "existing_task_id": task.id,
               "recommendation": "Wait for existing task to complete or coordinate"
           }
   ```

3. **Search for Completed Specifications**
   ```python
   completed_specs = task_list({
       "agent_type": "technical-requirements-specialist",
       "status": "completed",
       "limit": 50
   })

   # Check if specifications already exist for this feature:
   for task in completed_specs:
       if is_same_feature(task, current_requirements):
           # Load existing specifications
           existing_namespace = extract_namespace_from_task(task)
           specs = memory_get(namespace=existing_namespace, key="architecture")

           if specs and is_recent(task.completed_at, hours=48):
               return {
                   "status": "SPECIFICATIONS_EXIST",
                   "task_id": task.id,
                   "namespace": existing_namespace,
                   "recommendation": "Reuse existing specifications"
               }
   ```

4. **Exit Early if Specifications Exist**
   If valid specifications found within 48 hours:
   - Return reference to existing specifications
   - Do NOT create duplicate specifications
   - Suggest task-planner use existing namespace
```

**Expected Outcome**: Reduce redundancy from 10x to 1x.

### Priority 2: HIGH - Standardize Memory Storage

**Problem**: Inconsistent memory storage (30% compliance).

**Solution**: Enforce memory storage structure and validation.

**Implementation**:
```markdown
## Instructions Update

### STEP 8: Store Technical Specifications in Memory (UPDATED)

**CRITICAL**: Memory storage is REQUIRED. File creation is optional documentation.

1. **Define Memory Schema**
   ```python
   REQUIRED_MEMORY_SCHEMA = {
       "architecture": {
           "overview": str,
           "components": list,
           "patterns": list,
           "diagrams": str
       },
       "data_models": list,
       "api_specifications": list,
       "technical_decisions": list,
       "implementation_plan": {
           "phases": list,
           "testing_strategy": dict,
           "deployment_plan": dict
       },
       "suggested_agent_specializations": dict,
       "research_findings": list
   }
   ```

2. **Validate Before Storage**
   ```python
   def validate_technical_specs(specs):
       for key, schema in REQUIRED_MEMORY_SCHEMA.items():
           if key not in specs:
               raise ValueError(f"Missing required key: {key}")
           if not isinstance(specs[key], schema["type"]):
               raise TypeError(f"Invalid type for {key}")
       return True
   ```

3. **Store with Standard Namespace**
   ```python
   namespace = f"task:{tech_spec_task_id}:technical_specs"

   for key, value in technical_specifications.items():
       memory_add({
           "namespace": namespace,
           "key": key,
           "value": value,
           "memory_type": "semantic",
           "created_by": "technical-requirements-specialist",
           "metadata": {
               "feature": feature_name,
               "requirements_task_id": requirements_task_id,
               "created_at": timestamp()
           }
       })
   ```

4. **Verify Storage Success**
   ```python
   # Verify all required keys were stored:
   for key in REQUIRED_MEMORY_SCHEMA.keys():
       stored_value = memory_get(namespace=namespace, key=key)
       if not stored_value:
           raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to store {key} to memory")

   # Log storage confirmation:
   print(f"✅ Technical specifications stored to memory: {namespace}")
   print(f"   Keys: {list(REQUIRED_MEMORY_SCHEMA.keys())}")
   ```

5. **Create Files as Secondary Documentation** (Optional)
   Files are for human consumption, memory is for agent consumption:
   ```python
   # Optional: Create markdown documentation file
   write_file(
       path=f"docs/technical-specs/{feature_name}-technical-spec.md",
       content=format_as_markdown(technical_specifications)
   )
   ```

**VALIDATION GATE**: Do not proceed to Step 9 (spawn task-planner) until memory storage is verified.
```

**Expected Outcome**: 100% of tasks store to memory consistently.

### Priority 3: MEDIUM - Check for Existing Agents

**Problem**: Suggested agents without checking existence.

**Solution**: Scan `.claude/agents/` before suggesting.

**Implementation**:
```markdown
## Instructions Update

### STEP 9: Suggested Agent Specializations Identification (UPDATED)

1. **Scan Existing Agents First**
   ```python
   # List all existing agent files
   existing_agent_files = glob(".claude/agents/**/*.md")

   # Parse agent metadata from each file
   existing_agents = {}
   for file_path in existing_agent_files:
       agent_data = parse_agent_file(file_path)
       existing_agents[agent_data["agent_type"]] = {
           "path": file_path,
           "expertise": agent_data.get("expertise", ""),
           "tools": agent_data.get("tools", []),
           "responsibilities": agent_data.get("responsibilities", [])
       }
   ```

2. **Match Task Types to Existing Agents**
   ```python
   # For each task type in implementation plan:
   agent_mappings = {}
   for task_type, requirements in identified_task_types.items():
       # Check if existing agent can handle this:
       matching_agent = find_best_match(requirements, existing_agents)

       if matching_agent:
           agent_mappings[task_type] = {
               "agent_type": matching_agent["agent_type"],
               "exists": True,
               "path": matching_agent["path"],
               "needs_creation": False,
               "confidence": matching_agent["match_score"]
           }
       else:
           # Suggest new agent specification:
           agent_mappings[task_type] = {
               "suggested_agent_type": propose_agent_name(task_type),
               "exists": False,
               "needs_creation": True,
               "expertise": define_required_expertise(task_type),
               "responsibilities": list_required_responsibilities(task_type)
           }
   ```

3. **Store with Existence Flags**
   ```python
   memory_add({
       "namespace": f"task:{tech_spec_task_id}:technical_specs",
       "key": "suggested_agent_specializations",
       "value": {
           "existing_agents_used": [
               a for a in agent_mappings.values() if a["exists"]
           ],
           "new_agents_needed": [
               a for a in agent_mappings.values() if a["needs_creation"]
           ],
           "task_type_mappings": agent_mappings
       },
       "memory_type": "semantic",
       "created_by": "technical-requirements-specialist"
   })
   ```

4. **Provide Agent Inventory to Task-Planner**
   Include in task-planner prompt:
   ```markdown
   ## Existing Agent Inventory
   The following specialized agents already exist and can be used:
   - python-pydantic-model-specialist (.claude/agents/workers/)
   - sqlite-migration-specialist (.claude/agents/workers/)
   - mcp-tool-schema-specialist (.claude/agents/workers/)

   ## New Agents Needed
   The following agents need to be created (if not already existing):
   - [None identified - all required agents exist]
   ```
```

**Expected Outcome**: Task-planner receives accurate agent existence information.

### Priority 4: LOW - Scope Clarification (Prevent Retrospective Work)

**Problem**: One task created retrospective documentation for completed feature.

**Solution**: Add scope check at beginning.

**Implementation**:
```markdown
## Instructions Update

### STEP 1.5: Verify Implementation Status (NEW)

Before proceeding with technical specifications, confirm this is for UPCOMING implementation:

1. **Check Git History**
   ```python
   feature_keywords = extract_feature_keywords(task_description)
   git_history = bash(f"git log --oneline --all --grep='{feature_keywords}' | head -10")

   if git_history:
       print("⚠️  WARNING: Git history suggests this feature may already be implemented")
       print(f"Commits: {git_history}")
   ```

2. **Check for Existing Implementation**
   ```python
   # Check domain models for field existence
   if "add field" in task_description.lower():
       field_name = extract_field_name(task_description)
       model_files = glob("src/**/domain/models.py")

       for model_file in model_files:
           content = read_file(model_file)
           if field_name in content:
               print(f"⚠️  Field '{field_name}' already exists in {model_file}")
   ```

3. **Check for Feature Tests**
   ```python
   test_files = glob(f"tests/**/test_*{feature_keywords}*.py")

   if test_files:
       print(f"⚠️  Feature tests already exist: {test_files}")
   ```

4. **Exit if Implementation Complete**
   ```python
   if git_history or field_already_exists or test_files:
       return {
           "status": "FEATURE_ALREADY_IMPLEMENTED",
           "evidence": {
               "git_commits": git_history,
               "existing_implementation": model_file if field_already_exists else None,
               "test_files": test_files
           },
           "recommendation": "This feature appears to be implemented. For retrospective analysis, use 'architecture-analysis' task type instead of 'technical-requirements-specialist'."
       }
   ```

**IMPORTANT**: The technical-requirements-specialist is for FUTURE implementations, not retrospective documentation.
```

**Expected Outcome**: Prevent wasted effort on retrospective work.

## Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

The technical-requirements-specialist agent demonstrates **excellent technical capability** in:
- Creating comprehensive architectural specifications
- Providing rich context to downstream agents
- Evidence-based decision making
- Clear implementation planning

However, **critical workflow inefficiencies** were identified:
- **10x duplicate work** due to lack of deduplication checks
- **Inconsistent memory storage** causing data loss
- **No agent coordination** between invocations
- **Unclear scope** allowing retrospective work

### Recommendations Priority

1. **CRITICAL** - Add deduplication checks (Step 0)
2. **HIGH** - Enforce memory storage validation (Step 8 update)
3. **MEDIUM** - Check existing agents before suggesting (Step 9 update)
4. **LOW** - Add scope validation to prevent retrospective work (Step 1.5)

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1 (Immediate)**:
- Update agent instructions with Step 0 (deduplication)
- Add memory storage validation gate
- Test with sample task to verify 1x execution

**Phase 2 (Short-term)**:
- Add existing agent scanning (Step 9 update)
- Add scope validation (Step 1.5)
- Update agent template with examples

**Phase 3 (Long-term)**:
- Add agent coordination service
- Implement task queue deduplication at system level
- Create agent performance monitoring dashboard
