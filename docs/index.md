# Welcome to Abathur Documentation

**Abathur** is a powerful AI orchestration CLI tool that provides intelligent task queue management, swarm orchestration, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.

## Overview

Abathur enables developers to:

- **Manage Complex Tasks**: Intelligent task queue with dependency resolution and priority management
- **Orchestrate AI Agents**: Swarm-based orchestration for collaborative AI workflows
- **Integrate MCP Servers**: Seamless integration with Model Context Protocol for memory and task management
- **Execute Loops**: Autonomous execution loops for long-running workflows

## Key Features

### Task Queue Management
Sophisticated task queue system with support for:

- Task dependencies and dependency resolution
- Priority-based execution
- Task status tracking and monitoring
- Cancellation with cascade support

### Swarm Orchestration
Coordinate multiple AI agents to work together:

- Agent specialization and role assignment
- Inter-agent communication
- Parallel task execution
- Result aggregation

### MCP Integration
Built-in Model Context Protocol servers:

- **Memory Server**: Hierarchical memory management (semantic, episodic, procedural)
- **Task Queue Server**: Task management via MCP
- **HTTP MCP Server**: JSON-RPC over HTTP transport

### Autonomous Loops
Execute long-running workflows autonomously:

- Continuous execution monitoring
- Error handling and recovery
- Progress tracking
- Graceful shutdown
