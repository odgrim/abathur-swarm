# Abathur

**AI-Powered Task Orchestration with Intelligent Agent Swarms**

Abathur is a powerful CLI orchestration system that manages swarms of specialized Claude agents, enabling concurrent task execution with dependency management, iterative refinement, and comprehensive observability.

---

## What is Abathur?

Abathur transforms complex software development workflows into manageable, automated tasks executed by intelligent AI agents. Built with Clean Architecture principles and written in Rust, it provides a robust foundation for orchestrating multiple Claude agents working together on sophisticated projects.

Whether you're building features, refactoring code, or managing intricate task dependencies, Abathur coordinates specialized agents that work in parallel, retry on failure, and converge on optimal solutions through iterative refinement.

At its core, Abathur combines three powerful capabilities: a priority-based task queue with dependency resolution, a swarm orchestration engine for concurrent agent execution, and an integrated memory system for context preservation across tasks.

## Key Features

### :material-format-list-checks: **Task Queue Management**
Priority-based queue with full dependency support, SQLite persistence with WAL mode, automatic retry with exponential backoff, and task cancellation capabilities. Visualize task hierarchies with the built-in tree view.

### :material-robot-outline: **Concurrent Agent Swarms**
Run multiple Claude agents simultaneously with semaphore-based concurrency control, dynamic lifecycle management, and health monitoring. Scale your automation with configurable agent limits.

### :material-refresh: **Iterative Refinement Loops**
Execute tasks with multiple convergence strategies, automatic checkpointing for crash recovery, and configurable iteration limits. Let agents refine their work until quality thresholds are met.

### :material-connection: **MCP Integration**
Full MCP (Model Context Protocol) server lifecycle management, agent-to-server binding, and health monitoring with auto-restart. Extend capabilities with filesystem, GitHub, and custom MCP servers.

### :material-chart-line: **Comprehensive Observability**
Structured logging with complete audit trails, rich CLI output with tables and progress bars, and detailed resource and failure statistics. Know exactly what's happening at every stage.

### :material-file-tree: **Task Tree Visualization**
Hierarchical task tree rendering in the CLI with color-coded status indicators, Unicode/ASCII box-drawing support, and priority-based sorting. Understand complex task relationships at a glance.

## Why Abathur?

**Intelligent Orchestration**: Abathur isn't just a task runnerâ€”it's an intelligent orchestration system that understands task dependencies, manages agent lifecycles, and ensures work converges on quality solutions through iterative refinement.

**Built for Scale**: With semaphore-based concurrency control and efficient SQLite persistence with WAL mode, Abathur scales from single tasks to complex multi-agent workflows processing dozens of concurrent operations.

**Developer-Friendly**: Rich CLI output with tables, progress bars, and tree visualizations makes monitoring straightforward. Structured logging with audit trails ensures you can track every decision and action.

**Rust Performance**: The ongoing Rust rewrite brings type safety, fearless concurrency, and blazing performance to AI agent orchestration. Built with Clean Architecture principles for maintainability and extensibility.

## Project Status

!!! info "Rust Rewrite in Progress"
    Abathur is being rewritten from Python to Rust for improved performance, type safety, and concurrency. The Python implementation remains fully functional while the Rust version is being completed.

**Current Phase**: Phase 2 - Service Layer Implementation

- âœ… **Phase 1**: Foundation (domain models, error types, database, configuration)
- ðŸš§ **Phase 2**: Service layer, repositories, ports (In Progress)
- ðŸ“‹ **Phase 3**: CLI layer, orchestration, swarm coordination (Planned)
- ðŸ“‹ **Phase 4**: MCP integration, advanced features (Planned)

See [Architecture](explanation/architecture.md) for complete implementation roadmap.
