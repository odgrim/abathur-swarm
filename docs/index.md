# Abathur Swarm

**Intelligent CLI orchestration for autonomous agent swarms**

Abathur is a Rust-powered CLI system for managing swarms of specialized Claude agents with hierarchical task queues, concurrent execution, and iterative refinement. Build sophisticated agentic workflows with dependency management, persistent state, and seamless MCP integration.

### ðŸ¤– Autonomous Agent Swarm
Deploy multiple Claude agents concurrently with semaphore-based resource control, dynamic lifecycle management, and health monitoring.

[Explore Agents â†’](reference/agent-types.md)

### ðŸ§  Memory System
Persistent memory with semantic, episodic, and procedural storage patterns. Enable agents to learn, adapt, and build on previous work.

### ðŸ”„ Iterative Refinement
Execute tasks with configurable convergence strategies, automatic checkpointing, and crash recovery for complex multi-step workflows.

[Loop Execution â†’](reference/loop-execution.md)

### ðŸ“Š Rich Observability
Structured logging with audit trails, beautiful terminal output with tables and progress bars, and comprehensive resource monitoring.

## Why Abathur?

Abathur combines the power of Claude's capabilities with robust orchestration:

- **Type-Safe**: Built in Rust for performance, safety, and reliability
- **Scalable**: Handle complex multi-agent workflows with confidence
- **Persistent**: Never lose work with automatic state management
- **Observable**: Rich logging and monitoring for production deployments
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture with MCP support

!!! tip "Coming from Python?"
    Abathur is being rewritten from Python to Rust. The Python implementation remains functional and feature-complete. See our [migration guide](how-to/python-migration.md) for transition details.
